Great story, if you like Medieval Fantasy",22/02/2014,"(This is a review of the Kindle eBook version)I'm familiar with the classic DOS/Windows-era game that is based on this book. But it wasn't until I got this trilogy on Kindle that I truly got sucked into another world, another time...The story begins with a brief flurry of action, then slows into almost a mystery (with lots of names and places to follow), before the main action begins unfolding. Once the author got rolling, I was hooked. If you're into this genre of story, you should enjoy this book (and this trilogy). Highly recommended."

Forget the sour grapes. It's a worthwhile read.",21/11/1999,"I've read all of Feist's stuff but I almost passed this one up because of  all the bad reviews.  Well, ignore the reviews and follow your instincts.  If you saw a new Feist book in the store you would snap it up simply  because Feist wrote it and it is a new Midkemia adventure.  And guess what?  You would enjoy it.  I did.  I think all the sour grapes is just  because some people couldn't get the game connection out of thier minds and  it made them hyper critical.  So he made some extra money franchising his  work.  You'd think he made a video game out of the Bible.  Get over it  people.  Its his creation, he's entitled.  It may not be the best  example of his work (my vote is for A Darkness at Sethanon) but all said  and done, it is a good read and worth adding to your collection."

Wow",20/11/2018,"I love all the Riftwar stories. I fell deeply in love with the Mistress series. Lost many nights sleep, because I couldn’t put the book down. I started with hardbacks then to ebooks. In the ebook some things are left out, however they weren’t Necessary however the story line is true to the hardback."

Better than most reviews",31/07/2011,"This book is a fun read and much better than most of the reviews.  If you like Feist you will enjoy this book. The story is not quite the ""I can't put it down."" typeof others but still enjoyable.  I don't understand rating this book 1 star just because it isn't quite as engaging as others.I would rate this 4.5 if I could but due to the other bad reviews I'll bump it up to a 5!"

A decent novelization of a computer game",21/01/2014,"This novel takes one major thread from a computer game with many subplots and tries to make a single narrative of it.  This seems very difficult to me.  This final result is an OK novel, which says positive things to me about the author.  A good novel would have more focus on a primary character's viewpoint and more fleshed out background.  The faults seem primarily a consequence of the choice to turn a game into a novel, rather than on any weakness of the author.Readers who have played the game to the end won't be surprised by the plot twists, which is too bad.  Those who haven't played the game or read other books in this setting may not find the events without sufficient context.My recommendation is to try another book by this author.  If you like it, you may like this one as well."

Loved the old game and this has nostalgia for me",06/02/2019,Sat down and reread all of Mr. Feist's books this past year in order and this one is special because originally it came with a disk for the old pc video game which was amazing for the time and should be updated. Feist's world has plenty of ammo for a video game series today.

Wonderful as always",14/02/2019,"Though different than all the other books in format and style, it was a very good book nonetheless. The dialogue felt repetitive and brisk at times but who cares? I still enjoyed the book very much."

The worst of Feist's ""good enough"" fantasy books",09/05/2018,"Krondor: the Betrayal is probably Feist's worst book. It has all the issues common to his books, including misspelled names of people or places from previous books. wrong words, repeated conversations with different results, etc. He clearly doesn't have his books edited before publication (with the exception of the final book, Magician's End, which was very tightly written), but it's become clear that nobody familiar with the series (including the author) even bothers to read through it once it's done. Occasionally, the publisher will go back and correct errors (like that one book where the characters present in a scene changed mid sentence), but evidently it's not worth the effort in most of his books.Having said that, the author does get a bit of slack for the lackluster story here, as it wasn't written by him. This book is based on a computer game from the 90's, and the narrative was written (with Feist's blessing) by the developers. It works well enough for a game, but Feist should have approached his novelization with broader strokes. There's a lot of random enemy encounters and glossing over combat; back and forth between locations; side quests; etc., that make the book a bit of a slog—especially for anyone who has played the game already. A good bit of the dialogue is pulled directly from the game, to the point where it feels like Feist was playing the game on one screen and stopping every few minutes to write a couple paragraphs. The book would have been much better served had he simply worked from an outline.If you're reading through all of Feist's Midkemia books, I'd skip this trilogy. It was originally written out of order with the rest of his books, and while it does fill in some backstory for one or two characters in the later books, little that happens here ever gets mentioned again."

It's OK.",24/04/2015,"The description of 3 stars is ""It's okay,"" which is exactly how I would describe this book.  It reads more like I would assume a first draft would be for Feist.  Another way of putting it is that it's like a lot of the self-published books that sell for $1.99 on Amazon; OK but not literary by any means.  I could tell it's based on a computer game; the characters keep going back and forth over a lot of the same geography, which would keep graphic artists and programmers from having to come up with new visuals.  Would I recommend buying it?  Only for Feist fans who know how well he can write.  If you're a newbie, start with the first Riftwar book (available only in paperback) and get to know everyone while their relationships are forming."
