Great story, if you like Medieval Fantasy",22/02/2014,"(This is a review of the Kindle eBook version)I'm familiar with the classic DOS/Windows-era game that is based on this book. But it wasn't until I got this trilogy on Kindle that I truly got sucked into another world, another time...The story begins with a brief flurry of action, then slows into almost a mystery (with lots of names and places to follow), before the main action begins unfolding. Once the author got rolling, I was hooked. If you're into this genre of story, you should enjoy this book (and this trilogy). Highly recommended."

Forget the sour grapes. It's a worthwhile read.",21/11/1999,"I've read all of Feist's stuff but I almost passed this one up because of  all the bad reviews.  Well, ignore the reviews and follow your instincts.  If you saw a new Feist book in the store you would snap it up simply  because Feist wrote it and it is a new Midkemia adventure.  And guess what?  You would enjoy it.  I did.  I think all the sour grapes is just  because some people couldn't get the game connection out of thier minds and  it made them hyper critical.  So he made some extra money franchising his  work.  You'd think he made a video game out of the Bible.  Get over it  people.  Its his creation, he's entitled.  It may not be the best  example of his work (my vote is for A Darkness at Sethanon) but all said  and done, it is a good read and worth adding to your collection."

Wow",20/11/2018,"I love all the Riftwar stories. I fell deeply in love with the Mistress series. Lost many nights sleep, because I couldn’t put the book down. I started with hardbacks then to ebooks. In the ebook some things are left out, however they weren’t Necessary however the story line is true to the hardback."

Better than most reviews",31/07/2011,"This book is a fun read and much better than most of the reviews.  If you like Feist you will enjoy this book. The story is not quite the ""I can't put it down."" typeof others but still enjoyable.  I don't understand rating this book 1 star just because it isn't quite as engaging as others.I would rate this 4.5 if I could but due to the other bad reviews I'll bump it up to a 5!"

A decent novelization of a computer game",21/01/2014,"This novel takes one major thread from a computer game with many subplots and tries to make a single narrative of it.  This seems very difficult to me.  This final result is an OK novel, which says positive things to me about the author.  A good novel would have more focus on a primary character's viewpoint and more fleshed out background.  The faults seem primarily a consequence of the choice to turn a game into a novel, rather than on any weakness of the author.Readers who have played the game to the end won't be surprised by the plot twists, which is too bad.  Those who haven't played the game or read other books in this setting may not find the events without sufficient context.My recommendation is to try another book by this author.  If you like it, you may like this one as well."

Loved the old game and this has nostalgia for me",06/02/2019,Sat down and reread all of Mr. Feist's books this past year in order and this one is special because originally it came with a disk for the old pc video game which was amazing for the time and should be updated. Feist's world has plenty of ammo for a video game series today.

The worst of Feist's ""good enough"" fantasy books",09/05/2018,"Krondor: the Betrayal is probably Feist's worst book. It has all the issues common to his books, including misspelled names of people or places from previous books. wrong words, repeated conversations with different results, etc. He clearly doesn't have his books edited before publication (with the exception of the final book, Magician's End, which was very tightly written), but it's become clear that nobody familiar with the series (including the author) even bothers to read through it once it's done. Occasionally, the publisher will go back and correct errors (like that one book where the characters present in a scene changed mid sentence), but evidently it's not worth the effort in most of his books.Having said that, the author does get a bit of slack for the lackluster story here, as it wasn't written by him. This book is based on a computer game from the 90's, and the narrative was written (with Feist's blessing) by the developers. It works well enough for a game, but Feist should have approached his novelization with broader strokes. There's a lot of random enemy encounters and glossing over combat; back and forth between locations; side quests; etc., that make the book a bit of a slog—especially for anyone who has played the game already. A good bit of the dialogue is pulled directly from the game, to the point where it feels like Feist was playing the game on one screen and stopping every few minutes to write a couple paragraphs. The book would have been much better served had he simply worked from an outline.If you're reading through all of Feist's Midkemia books, I'd skip this trilogy. It was originally written out of order with the rest of his books, and while it does fill in some backstory for one or two characters in the later books, little that happens here ever gets mentioned again."

It's OK.",24/04/2015,"The description of 3 stars is ""It's okay,"" which is exactly how I would describe this book.  It reads more like I would assume a first draft would be for Feist.  Another way of putting it is that it's like a lot of the self-published books that sell for $1.99 on Amazon; OK but not literary by any means.  I could tell it's based on a computer game; the characters keep going back and forth over a lot of the same geography, which would keep graphic artists and programmers from having to come up with new visuals.  Would I recommend buying it?  Only for Feist fans who know how well he can write.  If you're a newbie, start with the first Riftwar book (available only in paperback) and get to know everyone while their relationships are forming."

lacking feist's usual flair",06/12/2014,"Very disappointing...  I should have read the reviews before buying (based on a video game?!  I never would have bothered) -- but it was Raymond Feist, it was Midkemia, what could go wrong?...I loved the first 13 books.  The original Rift War quadrilogy, the trilogy of 'Mistress of the Empire', the Krondor's sons duology, and the Serpent War saga.  (And personally, I think Feist's greatest is his completely unrelated novel, Faerie Tale.)  But Krondor the Betrayal has a more primitive feel to it.  It seems more amateurishly contrived; before discovering the video game connection, I'd wondered if it was something he'd written from an earlier project that had been abandoned for awhile... there is a definite evolution to Feist's writing skills as the books go along -- but even Magician, though not as eloquently written as those that would follow, was a great, solid story.All that being said, I know what Feist is capable of -- so I'm not going to give up on him based on one weak link... though methinks I'll jump ahead in the chain a bit, skip these sort of ""flashback"" episodes thrown in belatedly, and move on to the Darkwar Saga... and hopefully all can be well with the world again."

I loved Magician and the Riftwar so much",15/12/2016,"Feist's books went so downhill after the Riftwar Saga.  I loved Magician and the Riftwar so much, I was determined to read everything he wrote about this world.  Next in line was the Empire Trilogy, with Janny Wurts, which was absolutely amazing.  I now attribute every bit of that awesomeness to Wurts.  I couldn't wait to get back to Midkemia after the Empire Trilogy, but I've been nothing but disappointed with everything since.  The plot holes, the terrible writing, the boring stories, the horrendous editing - the same conversations happen multiple times between the same people with different outcomes and it's clearly meant to be the first time the conversation is had in both instances, they just forgot to edit out the conversation they decided not to go with.  This particular book is very superficial, very boring, and a complete waste of time.  I've been reading it for a year and still haven't managed to get through it.  I'm only still reading because I spent money on it, so I'm determined to finish.  I won't be reading any more of Feist's work."

I dont understand how he could drop the ball like this. It sounds like a high-school junior read the first for books and tried his best to write a follow up. Thank God it's over. I guess it's due to the fact that this one was a computer game first, then adapted into a novel? I am committed to reading the entire series, thats the only reason I made it to the last page."

Don't judge these books by the movie !!!",09/05/2008,"This series of books (especially, The Dark is Rising) is one of my favorites.  The recent movie, The Seeker, based on The Dark is Rising, did not do the book justice.  The moviemakers attempt to modernize the story, take out some of the mythological aspects, and add in some teenage angst trivialized the character of Will Stanton (the Seeker of the Signs), whose appeal is in part based on his dual nature as an ordinary 11 year old boy and the last of the Old Ones (immortals charged with the defending the Light against the Dark), and how he adjusts to being both at the same time.These books share some features with some of my other favorites:1)  Harry Potter books by JK Rowling;2)  Artemis Fowl books by Eoin Colfer;3)  Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quartet (A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door; A Swiftly Tilting Planet; Many Waters);4)  The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster with great line drawings by Jules Feiffer;5)  Septimus Heap books by Angie Sage...Septimus, like Will, is a seventh son of a seventh son;6)  Edward Eager's books (Half-Magic, Magic or Not?, Seven-Day Magic, Magic by the Lake, Knight's Castle, The Well-Wishers, The Thyme Garden).I was less enthralled with the Chronicles of Narnia as a child and on re-reading them as an adult....they are a bit preachy...and I never have been able to read through the Lord of the Rings (though I loved the great unabridged audiobook version that I listened to in my car while commuting to work a few years ago prior to the release of the movies).Any of these books can be enjoyed as good stories with quests and adventures, good and evil, with lessons about assuming responsibility, the nature of friendship, perserverance, and loyalty thrown in for good measure.  More literate (usually older) folks can appreciate the linguistic and mythological underpinnings of the books.So if you enjoyed any of the other books I listed above but haven't read The Dark is Rising sequence, why not check it out?  But don't bother watching the movie."

Over Sea, Under Stone was much better",03/01/2024,"Unlike other swords and sorcery books, this book offers no rule set that enables one to understand or anticipate the action.

A classic of the genre",23/02/2014,"""The Dark is Rising"" is the second in the five-volume cycle of the same name by Susan Cooper, and it is here that the tale of the conflict between the Light and the Dark begins to take full shape.The focus this time is no longer on the three Drew children, but on Will Stanton, the youngest of nine children, living in Buckinghamshire.  On his 11th birthday, strange events begin to whirl about him as his small village is beset by a winter storm of historic proportions, animals become frightened and wary around him, and he can't walk past a radio without it breaking into screeches of incoherent static.  Worse than these odd, but ultimately non-threatening issues however, is the sense of deep dread that is descending on his home, and dire warnings that beings called The Walker and The Rider are abroad in the countryside.Will soon learns that he is no ordinary boy, and that he has a major role to play in a cosmic battle that has raged since man first began to walk the earth.  Beset by supernatural enemies, but aided by fierce allies and his own courage, Will must complete a quest that will keep the Dark from rising.The first book in ""The Dark is Rising"" sequence, ""Over Sea, Under Stone,"" was originally written as a one-off, but Ms. Cooper returned to the core ideas of that story and used it as a launching point for a more expansive arc, which begins here.  ""The Dark is Rising"" was a Newbery Honor Book when it was first published, and deservedly so; beautifully written, it is a classic of the genre, with well-composed characters, a sense of wonder, and enough dread based on old English and Celtic mythology to make for a gripping read."

What Harry Potter Is Missing",30/11/2001,"Let's leave aside the question what J.K. Rowling may have pilfered from this classic (on his 11th birthday, the boy discovers he has magical power; his scar wards off evil; etc.).  What do the books of the Dark Is Rising sequence have that Harry Potter does not?1. Mythos.  The Dark Is Rising sequence comes complete with its own universe, myths, cosmic clashes and even eschatology.  Like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the Dark Is Rising lives and breathes in a very complete world.In fact, Cooper's mythology is adapted (and not adapted very much) from genuine British folklore and myth.  Herne the Hunter, the Drowned Hundred, the Holy Grail, etc.This gives the books a very ""real"", very British feel to them and a lot of depth.  It also means that enjoyment of these books translates quite easily into an interest in British and Celtic history and myth.2. Ethos.  Will Stanton comes into his powers and inherits grave, serious responsibilities.  The Light is engaged not in frivolous games involving broomsticks, but an eternal battle against the forces of the Dark, which seek to destroy humanity.  The Light is love and self-sacrifice; the Dark is hatred and exploitation.3. Just Plain Good Writing."

Interesting but unnecessarily long",25/06/2023,"I read this to my three kids. We had already read the first book. This book started off very suspenseful and interesting, but it seemed to drag out as it went. I feel it could be much shorter without losing anything important. So much of the writing is descriptive rather than dialogue and that gets really boring to read, especially for kids. Pages and pages without anyone talking, just describing scenery and feelings. It was kind of relief to be done with and I don't think we'll read the third. There are much longer books that hold our interest better, so it's not the length that made us lose interest."

Audio Book of ""The Dark Is Rising"" is Exciting",31/01/2010,"I have previously read all of the books in the ""Dark is Rising"" Sequence, and recently decided to buy the audio books for my youngest son, who is 12. The audio book of ""Over Sea, Under Stone"" is good but takes a long time to build up and get the listener's attention. But the audio book of ""The Dark is Rising,"" which is also unabridged, has a good reader, and moves quickly into the plot and keeps the listener engaged. Comparing it to the film ""The Seeker,"" you can see how the film telescopes the plot of several novels in the series and leaves a lot out. If you enjoy listening to audio books with your children or on your own, I recommend getting this series, but starting with this one, since the sequence of the first two books can be reversed without interfering with the cumulative plot. Thereafter I would follow them in sequence. I like the fact that these books, and many other young adult novels, are unabridged, because in these books every word often tells. Whereas I don't mind abridged adult thrillers, since they are usually not that well written in any event, and you listen to them for the plot while on a long trip."

A hallmark of my childhood, doesn't quite live up to my memory of it",14/07/2014,"As a child, I loved this book.  It felt like a great journey into a magical world all around us, a journey we took through the eyes of the protagonist Will Stanton.  When I recently re-read the book with my daughter, I found that it didn't quite live up to my memories of it.  The sense of discovering a hidden side to our world is by far the strongest part of the novel, but reading it now I found the characters to be extraordinarily passive, particularly the main character Will.  Throughout most of the novel he is drawn from place to place, and events bring to him a steady stream of allies, enemies, learning, and treasure--but we rarely see Will taking active steps to control the events around him.  Even his allies seem to spend most of the novel waiting for the right time or events--almost all the initiative in this book is taken by The Dark--but we get to see them very little, and understand them even less.  The result is that when you put the novel down, you may feel like you just saw an interesting landscape--but it is hard to find the conflicts in the story, or the protagonist's response to them, that could have any parallel in real life.Nevertheless, I've awarded it four stars, mostly because of how strongly the book stood out in my mind for so many years.  The sense of excitement at finding hidden depths in our world, of reading a book that could teach you all you need to know of magic in one sitting, of the beautiful and elemental signs, of a race of Old Ones who lived alongside us but carried the memories of a conflict that had spanned millenia--all these and more were fantastic bits of worldbuilding that I now wish had been accompanied by a stronger storyline."

second in the fantasy series for middle readers",12/01/2002,"Will Stanton is the seventh son of a seventh son -- which means he lives in a crowded, noisy family! As the book opens, Will is excited about his approaching eleventh birthday, but he is also alarmed by strange goings on in the neighborhood -- the birds are acting strangely and none of the family's animals will approach him. Soon Will learns why these things are happening. He is about to be indoctrinated into his rightful position as the last of the Old Ones -- an ancient race that has been protecting the world from the conquest of evil. Now it's Will's turn to shoulder some of the burden and participate in the struggle. That's an awful lot for an 11-year old to take on! But Will is not alone. He meets others who will help him, in particular Merriman, a gruff but kindly mentor figure.""This night will be bad. And tomorrow will be beyond imagining."" Susan Cooper is a gifted writer and she sets a mood of foreboding creepiness right from the beginning. While there is an almost constant aura of menace, there is minimal violence, and Will constantly learns lessons of bravery, honor, and the importance of knowledge and learning. Sort of H. P. Lovecraft meets the Hardy Boys.I agree with some criticism that there is too little struggle and problem solving involved in actually getting the six signs Will needs to find, but the story is still strong and a worthwhile read for middle readers."

A Well Written Book, Recommended",08/03/2014,"'The Dark is Rising', the second book in the 'Dark is Rising' series, is a very popular book, and highly recommended by my families and friends. I purchased this book based on the glowing reviews written by other delighted customers on this website and store, Amazon, and this book has lived up to my expectations.  After reading this book, I now understand why most of the trustful customer reviews highly praise this particular book, 'The Dark is Rising'. This book is well written and has many descriptive passages, so it did not surprise me that the writer, Susan Cooper studied J.R.R. Tolkien's ( ""Lord of the Rings"" ) writing style in his passages.  However, along with it's well written passages and it's skillfully woven myths, this book is relatively simple with no good vocabulary, so I would definitely NOT reccomend using the writing in this book in any way before an exam or test.  But overall, I would recommend reading this book for fun or leisure. Happy Reading!F. Wu"

Wonderful Book and Series",04/04/2022,I enjoyed this book (and series) as a child and as an adult. It's an epic story of good (the Light) trying to triumph over evil (the Darkness). It's about the  characters who must play their part in helping the Light prevail against the rising Darkness. And the sacrifices that sometimes must be made.There are five books in this series. I recommend reading them all in order.

Well written, but ultimately disappointing",20/08/2009,"I purchased this book based on the strength of the glowing reviews on Amazon, which usually are a reliable guide.  I enjoy good fantasy fiction, and was looking forward to a different take on familiar story lines in this novel.The writing, plotting, and characterization are all strong - the author is clearly skilled at her craft.  However, I found the novel, ultimately, to be an unsatisfying experience, which failed to live up to the strong reviews, and not worth the time I invested in the book.While I found the main character sympathetic, there were several elements that just didn't work for me - they didn't draw me in fully.  First, the main character - a young boy - transforms himself too quickly and painlessly to a more knowing state.  One expects something more of a coming of age tale, and one does not get it.  He magically acquires the knowledge he needs. OK.... so perhaps he will make some mistakes given his youth and inexperience? Perhaps his emotions will get the better of him and lead to some crisis that will keep our interest?  Not really...  Things proceed a bit too smoothly for our hero, for my tastes.Second, the ""villain""/antagonist of the work is amorphous - it is... the ""dark.""  It takes on human or animal form on occasion, but the reader doesn't develop any real sense of dread from ""the dark,"" and no real feel for an the intelligence/plan at work behind this force.  The suspense wasn't there for me - I'll just say even when ""the dark"" succeeds, it feels ... generic, not personal.So, while the author had some original elements mixed together in creative ways, she did not tie them together into a tight narrative that pulled me along.  I would say this is more for long-time fantasy fans, rather than general readers with an interest in fantasy."

Amazing series. I loved these books as a kid, I still love them now.",15/01/2021,"Susan Cooper's ""The Dark Is Rising"" series was my favorite as a young teen.  Now that my son has started reading them, I'm reading them again, too.  But honestly, I've re-read them several times in the years in between as a mature adult.  Wonderful!  A bit simpler than the Harry Potter books, this imaginative and exciting series is great for kids around the age of 11, the same age as Will in the story.  Start with Book 1 ""Over Sea, Under Stone"" if possible.  The series is best read in sequence for maximum enjoyment."

OK---One of my faves!",27/07/2004,"On the eve of his eleventh birthday, Will Stanton's world began to change, drawing him into a legacy that would change his life--and the story of the long conflict between the Light and Dark for the fate of the world.For he was the last of the Old Ones, quasi-immortals born to keep the world from domination from the Lords of the Dark. And in his time of learning, from the strangeness of his birthday eve to the worst danger on MidWinter's eve, he set in motion a quest for the six great Signs of the Light that alone could save the world from domination by the last and greatest rising of the Dark.I adore this series, and this is one of the best written books in it. I'm fascinated by Will's double nature and enjoy characters like Merriman, Hawkins. And I'll never listen to Greensleeves again without thinking a little of the chimes of doors of time, or the hint of Paul playing a very old flute.Marvelous.This is a sequel to Over Sea, Under Stone."

A highlight of my adult life was heading to Wales and seeing Lake Llyn and Cader Idris!Though this book is the second in the series, it does stand alone as a starting point (and is, in fact, the one I originally started with).

A good novel",09/06/2018,"I found it compelling. There were a few passages I'd have liked phrased differently, they were a little awkward or obscure. I can practically guarantee everyone thought that but of different passages. It's that sort of book. However, it doesn't get in the way of anything.I would recommend the series. This is no Harry Potter, though, so anyone expecting that sort of fantasy will be disappointed or at least confused. Nor is this Tolkienesque.

Good read",05/12/2008,"I feel like all I do is give Terry 5 stars when I rate his books, so if I had to give a 4 star, it would be to the Black Unicorn. Why? It's probably my least favorite in the Landover series. I just finished reading it for the second time and although I thoroughly enjoyed it, it just didn't grab me as much as the other books in the series. It reminded me of books like The Last Unicorn and Alice in Wonderland. I am saying this in reference to the Unicorn and Cat charachters in the book. I think Terry was trying to revive some of our old childhood stories and present elements of them in a new light. Still, I loved the book, just not as much as the others:)This book also turned me against Willow's father. (Really have harsh feeling for him after 'Wizard at Large, haha.)I will add though that any new readers to the Landover series, will love this book and if you are a fan of the Shanara series, you'll like how the Landover series isn't actually setup like a trilogy, where one book continues into another. They are all chronoligical, but each book presents new adventures, so be prepared for fun, suspense and excitement."

oldie but goodie",26/09/2013,"Started the Landover series in 1985 but never finished. Don't really remember why. Could have been that I considered the Shannara saga more appealing at the time or had started reading Salvatore or Jordan books. Either way, after almost 30 years I picked this series of Brooks books back up. Magic Kingdom was better than I remembered (except for the too often use of the ""in style"" use of 80's foul language in a fantasy novel) and this book The Black Unicorn was even better. I am now reading Wizard at Large and am probably 1/3 through that book and at the moment am not nearly as taken as I was reading The Black Unicorn."

Great book in series - Kindle version still plagued with errors",05/07/2009,"I read the entire Landover series years ago and was happy to see them in Kindle format. I finished the first one - Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold! and was very disappointed at all the spelling & formatting errors, but since it was free, I couldn't complain too much, right?So I purchased ""The Black Unicorn"" - Kindle version. Again, on just about every other page there are misspelled words, formatting errors, strange characters (print type, not story type.) I'm really shocked at how poorly these things have been converted to Kindle format.As a comparison, I read the Kindle version of the first Shannara trilogy and don't remember any errors, if there were, they were few.I've written Amazon, got the standard canned (thank you for your feedback) response and also wrote to the publisher - Del Rey but haven't received a reply yet.I'm taking 2 full stars off this time for the poor conversion to Kindle format. The book is great but since I'm reviewing the Kindle version, it loses points.I just ordered the 3rd one in the series (stupid, I know) but I'm curious to see if there are still errors. If so, I may ask for a refund.To summarize: Great book, poor conversion to Kindle format."

Great classic SF",03/12/2023,"A classic work of science fiction, I, Robot is a collection of short stories. Each story is narrated by Dr. Susan Calvin on the eve of her retirement. Most of the stories have a logic puzzle: why is the robot behaving in this fashion. It was fun to reread these and find myself just as fascinated as I was in high school. The book does make me question the state of the world as we stand on the edge of a world with AI.I would strongly recommend this book to any fan of science fiction."

His insights into what life might be like in our time is pretty sweet. He gets a lot wrong and a lot more right about the implications of AI on work, governance, culture, that gamut.The characters are thin, but that’s true of 95% of the sci-fi and fantasy genres."

Wonderful, Insightful",12/11/2023,"Sometimes, you finally get around to reading a book everyone calls a classic, and when you finish, your first reaction is, ""Yep, that was a classic."" And such as it is with I, Robot, Isaac Asimov's groundbreaking science fiction of a future inhabited by robots. This review won't spoil anything, but the number of concepts and ideas Asimov anticipates is incredible. Accelerating technological developments today and driving conversations about ethics, the limits or danger of artificial intelligence, the future of work, and many other issues. Asimov writes about this and more in the decades-old book."

Hard to read",14/01/2024,The book started with a family that had a robot that played with and watched their child. I thought the story would take the course of more robots in society with increasing abilities until they took over. Unfortunately the actual story went from one scenario where the robots exhibited some type of glitch that was discussed to the point of boredom to another scenario that discussed other glitches and on and on. Towards the end the robots were created in human form and people didn’t know if they were human or not. Very hard to read. I skipped sections that seemed to have no purpose or ending.

Friendly nice stories about robots",04/04/2023,"This book is a loosely connected series of stories about robots. Each of them is a chapter and each chapter addresses a dilemma which the 3 rules of robots are key to solve. In that way, each chapter is entertaining and surprising in its own. Overall they tell a story, but there is no overarching argument, which is why I give it only 4 stars. Because each chapter is independent and thus doesn't build into something bigger"

Great Book",28/11/2018,"I, Robot is a great book to read and I would recommend it to everyone. Asimov used the cultural trend of futuristic science and the fear of what could happen extremely well. Through each story humanity was faced with a new challenge and fear. Robots in the book were becoming more and more like humans. In the way of developing personalities and eventually realizing that they are superior. This is the biggest fear of robotics then and even now.I personally enjoyed reading I, Robot. Reading about the types of fear that people had during Asimov's time and its relevance now makes the book more personal. The constant struggle between technology and humans is an everyday challenge for us now and Asimov depicts our lives now almost to a ""T"". The point of complete independence for robots is in the not too far future for us, especially with the develop of super computers like Watson and Amazon's household aid Alexa.The book from an academic standpoint is phenomenal. Asimov uses the fear from his current day and the use of what could possibly happen and turns it into a very real situation. The book works as a conglomerate, keeping each story distinctive, but working as a whole to the conclusion. The stories add to each other to show the development of technology over time. All of the developments lead to the last story and the struggle of humans losing control of themselves. I would have liked to have known more details about how each development of robots affected the world around it and the consequences or benefits from these developments through out time."

Still a classic",17/04/2007,"I, Robot bears more resemblance to a series of short stories than it does to a true novel.  While certain characters recur through most of the stories, each segment is pretty well self-contained within a loose framing story.  While time has obviously passed this book by in some respects (some dates for the events have already passed), it really doesn't damage the story in any meaningful way.  The characters are interesting, the story is strong, and the overall themes are just as valid today as the day they were written.The common thread running through these stories is the ""malfunction"" of robots and where their artificial nature ends and whether life begins at some point.  I don't want to spoil details for those who haven't read the book but is interesting how many of these apparent malfunctions turn out to be something very different once the robot's perspective is understood.  In fact, as we gain a deeper understanding of robots, it seems like we also gain insight into ourselves.All in all, I found this book interesting and entertaining.  I liked it enough that I will buy the second in the series and that may be the strongest recommendation I can give.  I have seen a few reviewers trash the book for not being the same as the movie, apparently ignorant of the fact that this book is nearly 60 years old and that it is the filmmakers who cashed in on Asimov's work and not the other way around.  As long as you don't expect to find a Will Smith clone in here and take it for what it is, I would recommend I, Robot with no reservations."

Review from someone new to Asimov",17/02/2015,"I stumbled upon Isaac Asimov books a few weeks ago after seeing a tweet (yes, shameful on my part) from Elon Musk about the Foundation series.  I started out reading ""Foundation"" but then quickly felt I should look further into these stories because I just like I wanted to know more of the history. It's a long story but I basically did a bit more research and found that ""I,Robot"" was one of the first books I should read as it provided the framing of the entire Galactic series.  I believe there are about 16 - 18 books which covers the Robots, Galactic Empire and Foundation stories (each having a set of books).  And although you can read each set of books on their own e.g. reading just the Foundation books is perfectly fine......you would do yourself an injustice by skipping the other sets as the all give notes of origin to certain characters and elements to each future story.  As other reviewers note, this is a collection is short stories and not a novel of one.  I just finished this book and now moving onto ""The Complete Robot""........and from the two books I've read/listened so far, I have not once been disappointed.  There were moments OMG when there were revelations in the story which I did not foresee.  One thing you should take into consideration.....while I think anyone would enjoy this book, don't compare it to the movie.  It is, as mentioned, a collection of short stories and only ties in some of the characters from the movie.  And while I think anyone would enjoy this book, do read it as a stepping stone.  You will be glad you did."

I'm such a slacker.",10/04/2021,"First, I didn't buy and read this until long after watching the I, Robot movie with Will Smith.  Secondly, I didn't write this review until about 7 years after reading the book.  I kind of think it's neat how the part of the book that evolved into the movie is really just a short story.  Then again, they got Maximum Overdrive out of what (as memory serves) was a 2 page short short story in a Stephen King book.  Anyway, back on topic - As a sci-fi fan I was really disappointed in myself for not reading this sooner.  It was quite enjoyable.  It's interesting to see where other authors have built on stuff like this.  If it's so awesome why not 5 stars?  Because I haven't felt any particular desire to go back and re-read it in the past 7 years."

Read it in the context of its own time",12/03/2006,"I first read _I, Robot_, 25 years ago. And, like everybody else, I was floored by the depth and simplicity of the Three Rules. (Personally, I liked the R. Daneel Olivaw series better, where Asimov puts his human protagonist in the unwilling role of solving murders... and the three laws are just as important there.)I re-read the book after seeing the movie, once I realized how little I'd remembered of the book's details. And I was surprised to see just how little of the book was used; it's basically the presence of Dr Susan Calvin (who isn't supposed to be pretty) and the three laws. The rest of the movie is a figment of someone ELSE's imagination. (It's entertaining, by the way, as long as you don't expect anything of Asimov in it.)What struck me in re-reading the collection of short stories is how much it's a function of its time... for both good and ill. When Asimov wrote these stories, for instance, the idea that a woman could be the pre-eminent robopsychologist was not a typical belief. More power to him for creating the character; but a modern reader won't have the same expectations as would a reader from the book's original era. Imagine seeing Star Wars for the first time, today; you'd think, ""THOSE were considered awesome special effects?!"" because the world has moved on since then. But this is what set the bar for classic SF, just as Star Wars influenced sfx forever.DO read this book; there's a reason this is considered a classic. However, keep in mind that its slightly thin and wooden characterization (Susan Calvin comes alive only because Asimov's thin brush strokes are so precise) was a function of its time."

Great Classic Asimov",10/11/2018,"A while ago, I got sick of binge watching mindless shows and decided to binge read some of the classics of science fiction. I had not read any Asimov before, and figured that I, Robot was a good starting point. This book is actually a collection of short stories that take place in a future which doesn’t seem all that remote these days. Robots, and more importantly, the “positronic brain”, have become the leading technologies. In the early stories in the book, robots and their brains are in their earlier stages of development and they evolve considerably throughout the book. What I like about these stories is the fact that the underlying stories and their nuances are solid and well developed, while the robots and futuristic technology are more of a setting. Central to these underlying stories are the Three Laws, which lead to many unique and interesting problems. While this probably isn’t Asimov’s greatest book, it is an excellent introduction to his overall style. This book is a great starting point, and it got me hooked. As a result, I wound up reading the Robots series, the Galactic Empire series, and the Foundation series. Give it a try. You may get hooked too. On another note, the movie of the same name really doesn’t have much to do with the book. The movie took bits and pieces and then built around them."

Robots must follow the rules...",10/07/2004,"Re-reading ""I, Robot"" before the movie comes out was a good idea, I'm glad I did.  For me, reading Asimov if often a fond trip down memory lane.But if you have never read Asimov or looking for somewhere to start, I would highly recommend ""I, Robot"" as a first glimpse into Asimov's world(s).  Here is a wonderful and timeless collection of nine short stories that all center around a central theme; The Three Laws Of Robotics.The three laws are: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.  2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.These laws are the central theme to each individual story, and connecting them is a running ""Runaround"", ""Reason"", and ""Catch That Rabbit"".  Always under the direst of circumstances, they must figure out the malfunction of the robot before something terrible happens.  Very entertaining stories.Some of the other stories are about Dr. Calvin's personal experiences, such as ""Liar"" and ""Little Lost Robot"", but all fall back onto the laws as their basic theme, and whether or not humans will ever accept robots among them.Once finished with ""I, Robot"", I very highly recommend the ""Foundation"" series, one of my favorite Asimov themes, along with the Robot Trilogy and another favorite, ""Nightfall"".  Asimov has the gift of creating lively, likeable characters with a technical backdrop to his all-to-human stories, and always infuses a bit of humor into them.Truly one of the great masters of Sci-Fi, Asimov is a must-read in my opinion, and ""I, Robot"" is a wonderful starting point.Enjoy!"

A classic",20/07/2022,"I, Robot is a sci fi classic of collected short stories by Asimov — published in 1950. Interesting to see what Asimov, a prof of chemistry, was able to predict and not predict about the world 70 years down the road. What is clever in the book is how a robot psychologist is able to get into the mind of robots and even out smart them. You can also find some precursors of Star Trek and Star Wars in the stories (e.g. hyperspace). No aliens or ETs however. A fun quick read."

Great stories, bad narrator",27/07/2005,"(I'm reviewing the audio CD edition.)I've always loved these stories.  Warmly human, insightful, clever and entertaining.  Asimov's diction sometimes sounds very old-fashioned, and his characters can seem a tad cliched or flat.  But the stories themselves are hugely entertaining.My disappointment is with the narrator.  I've heard this narrator on one other book, and I didn't like him in it, either.  But in that case, I hated the book (a pulp fiction mystery--I should have known better).  I've come to realize that this guy simply doesn't know how to narrate.  He seems to feel that he must cram as much emotion as he can into every sentence.  The truth is that, in most cases, most of the time, narrating doesn't requiring any serious emoting.  So he's always giving emotional spins to lines that shouldn't have any.  Rising inflections cause sentences to end with an interrogative tone that they shouldn't have.  Long pauses in the middle of sentences imply things--sarcasm, doubt, fear--that the text doesn't justify.  Characters come off as sounding smarmy, even insulting, when in fact they were intended to speak straightforwardly and sincerely.Even when the text does have a certain level of emotion in it, the narrator's reading is unpredictable.  Sometimes he does a good job;  other times he sounds like he's trying too hard.  It's not that he over-emotes, necessarily.  It's more a matter of sounding convincing.  Some readers can narrate the most wildly maudlin or melodramatic scenes, and sound convincing.  Others can't manage to portray mild surprise convincingly.As a result, I've found that I can only listen to this book a bit at a time, because I grow so thoroughly annoyed with the narration.  I have to mentally re-speak the words inside my head, shorn of all the overwrought histrionics.Ironically, this problem ends on the last story of the book.  It's a much more detached, dry, analytical story than all of the previous stories;  a good bit of it is narrated by a character.  So we have a narrator reading a character who is himself narrating.  Suddenly, the goofiness of the narration in the earlier stories is gone.  I won't say that he reads like a robot (to make a bad pun), but he simply reads normally.  They way I wish he had read the entire book.  Yet the story, although interesting, is probably the least fun to listen to, because it is so analytical.My only other quibble (a very minor one) is Will Smith's face on the box.  This book has nothing to do with the horrid movie of the same name.  This book contains the original stories, not the shoot-'em-up story in the movie.  The publisher should have been able to divine that the people who would bother to read Asimov's stories are not at all the type of people who would go see Will Smith playing his usual grin-and-shoot macho action hero character.  And if anyone bought this audio book thinking that it would be (one shudders to think) some sort of dramatization of the movie, they would be awfully disappointed.Overall, I can't recommend this book simply because of the narration.  Hopefully there will one day be a better narration."

Received book in 5 days (not bc if seller but bc USPS took book to Illinois & Ohio back to eastern end of Long Island even tho it was shipped from a town about hour & half from me). Pages were pristine, cover & binding were perfect. For the +/- $6-7 bucks I paid for this, it was well worth it. Hardcover as well. I will def be buying from this seller again (Owlbooks) bc I couldn’t be happier with the condition. You can see in the pics how perfect the inside of book were, pages perfect, no creases or anything.

If you are a native NY'er (the last of a dying breed) who reads ""Page Six"" or waits to see who will be waiting outside on a red carpet anywhere in the city, you know who some of these people are meant to represent, if not then you may be shocked at how whiny and spoiled these 4 Blondes really are (I mean if you married a prince and all he wanted was kids...come that's too easy, right?).  Either way, it's a pretty fair representation.The sad part is that people who hate this book are the ones who think rich people live happy little lives just like in the pictures.  I really enjoyed peeking behind the curtain and getting a glimpse that no money or fame can substitute for good old fashioned common sense and mutual respect for each other.Everyone can relate to this book since we all have known married or single friends who show one persona and then when the ball drops they are all of a sudden divorced, or depressed or even hitting bottom only to leave us wondering ""how the heck did that happen?""."

Ugh.",06/03/2001,"I gave this book two stars only because I figured the first two stories--stupid though they may be--still could get 3 stars while the last two were just completely boring and pointless.  I don't mind tabloid-y, gossipy, trashy novels one bit, but for heaven's sake don't make them boring!  That's the cardinal sin.  I also found myself wondering how the author felt about the 4 main characters in each of the stories as well as the society they all lived in.  The reflexive answer would be that she would probably be just as repulsed by them as all the readers.  But I wonder about that.  First of all, she clearly seems to know the world whereof she writes inside and out.  And how could she know it so well unless she lived it?  And second, look at that photo on the back!  It looks as if she is EXACTLY like one of the characters in her little novellas (with slightly less blonde hair).  With her come-hither expression and attempted seductive pose, I was thinking, maybe this is Janey Wilcox and Princess Cecelia.  So maybe her view of these women is more understanding (maybe even approving) than all the readers seemed to find them."

SITC gets more intimate but looses some splash",18/08/2004,"Right after reading $eXz In The City, I tore into Four Blondes, looking for a happy extension to the reading pleasure I previously received from Candace Bushnell.  I wasn't disappointed, for the most part.Bushnell keeps up her frantic, fragmented pace in Four Blondes that she mastered with SITC, but takes a closer, edgier look at four women in particular.  While I thought these four women would interact throughout the book, they really don't.  It is actually four separate stories of New York women, and I think that let me down just a tad.First we have Janey, a model, who realizes her only ambition has been getting a man (any man) to pay for her summer in the Hamptons.  Of all four stories, I liked Janey's the best.  Though she is a ambitionless leech, I found myself actually liking her.Next is Winnie Dieke, married to James, no children.  Winnie is a journalist, as is James, and after seven years of marriage is wondering if James is the best she will ever do.  They don't care much for each other, but can't seem to let go of their relationship for mostly selfish reasons.Third is the story of Princess Cecelia, a beautiful girl who marries a real Prince.  This was my least favorite segment, and the reason my rating dropped from 4 stars to 3.  I simply could not relate to Cecilia at all, she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I felt it was a little beneath Bushnell to not have come up with at least one, since she is so very good at making likeable personalities out of despicable people.Fourth and last, is the story of a writer to travels to England to write about how the English have bedroom relationships.  The first person narrator of this story is never named, except for what seems to be a nickname of ""Minky"".  Minky was definitely a fun personality, and someone I could see myself liking to be around.All in all, Four Blondes is a good book, but definitely better if you accustom yourself to Bushnell's style first with SITC.  Enjoy!!"

TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME",04/12/2003,"I must agree with the majority on this one.  It has to be the worst book I've ever read in my life.I made the mistake of buying a used copy online without reading any of the reviews first.  Of course, I'm thinking, ""Hey, she wrote SATC, she's gotta be pretty good"".  But, oh, was I ever wrong!  Now I know why the book itself was only sold for 89 cents and I SERIOUSLY regret paying the S&H for it.  What a waste!!Don't think I've ever been unable to finish a book, but I just couldn't torture myself with this literary garbage any longer.  I never made it past the 2nd part about Winnie.  I was so disgusted with the first character, Janey, and I HATED the way the second part was written.I just received a copy of Bushnell's 'Trading Up' as a part of an online book club and I returned it immediately.  If I didn't like Janey in 4 Blondes, I'll hate an entire book about her upper-class wannabe lifestyle.  Hello, she's a shallow, self-absorbed prostitute!!!Please, I beg you, don't waste your time on this one."

whitty and refreshingly honest look at four women in NY",18/01/2001,"I have been a fan of Sex and the City for quite a while, so I decided to give this book a try, hoping it would hold my interest for a bit... I was not dissappointed!Finding a good stopping point was rather difficult, as each page developed a new twist to the story.This book did not sugar coat any aspect of human, in particular female, nature: obsession with looking good, being successful and popular, and having money, lots of it!  As much as we try to deny it, these thoughts circulate in our minds,  but almost no one ever has the guts to say it all, exactly how it is...In this book Candace B. does exactly that, boldly and with an amazing sense of humor and sarcasm at all of this.If sex is not something you would prefer to read about, this is not for you. Otherwise, this book is time and money well-spent.  Can't wait for the next book from this fabulous (and gorgeous) author!"

I just finished Candace Bushnell's Carrie Diaries which I loved. That book was an easy, enjoyable read.  This one started off ok then just kept getting worse. The book is a series of 4 different stories of New York Women. The first story wasn't that bad. But the second story was a total waste of time reading. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. I did not like the style of how that story was written either. It was just weird.  I am onto the third story now, only a few pages into it and so far it has started out as bad as the second story.  I hope her other books are better than this one.

Roughly written, Chaotic stories",31/08/2018,"The book contains 4 bland stories about uninteresting women. The first story is slightly entertaining, but unrealistic and features very shallow and unimpressive characters. From there, the stories become increasingly chaotic, unstreamlined, and sloppily written stories. The author appears to have been in an extreme hurry to rush through and finish the book. It's as if unedited or even reviewed by the author before submission. Very sloppy, messy writing, which is greatly lacking character, even in the world of gratuitous, shallow beach-reads"

Bushnell has another winner",01/11/2000,"Once again, Candace Bushnell proves her superiority as an  observer and as a writer.  She accurately picks up on the stereotypes of those personalities which so frequently flourish best in Manhattan and East Hampton.  Anyone who hasn't been to these places may not appreciate how dead-on are her portrayals.  With a writing style that is spare and distinctive, FOUR BLONDES makes an interesting read.  Ultimately, all the heroines in it are empowered, making this is the best kind of post-feminist fiction, thought-provoking without being preachy."

Pleasant Read, if not as Good as the First",15/03/2016,"I read the original Stargirl in high school. It was one of the greatest literary surprises I've ever experienced and a testament to the warning not to judge a book by its cover. It remains one of my favorite books to this day. I was not aware of a sequel until I was a number of years older and I snapped it up immediately.Several readers have posted negative reviews based on the fact the title character is now the narrator. Her enigmatic presence is punctured in the sequel as we see the world through her eyes. This is not a negative thing. It's fine to not enjoy this perspective if what you enjoyed about the first book was Stargirl as an ideal, but as a character, I felt the sequel humanized her in a way that was very positive. She's still an atypical, altruistic, even magical girl, but one who has experienced the sting of heartbreak and has sobered. Just a little. She deals with responsibility. She questions romance. She's a person and an interesting one.Her pining throughout the book for Leo, the narrator of the first novel, has been highlighted by some reviewers as a flaw. I disagree. Every one of us has experienced that before. I can look back through my own diary entries from high school and see how desperately involved I was with the fleeting romances of teenagerhood. This is a normal part of growing up and I believe the book handles it in such a way that we can all relate.The diary/letter format may throw people off as it is very different from the linear narrative of the original, but I found it interesting. I enjoy diaries and have long kept one myself, so the story felt more organic to me in this format. It won't work for everyone and that's understandable.The book isn't perfect. Many of the side characters feel phony. A few of them serve as walking literary devices with no personality of their own, which feels a little heavy handed much of the time. Even the better characters seem to serve limited purpose beyond providing Stargril a platform from which to speculate about the universe. The first book captured high school students more organically. The writing, while in no way bad, seems to falter in finding its voice. There are ""entries"" that I can believe were written by a teenage girl and others that feel like I'm reading a YA novel. I expected Stargirl's voice to be more dynamic and captivating.Even with its flaws, this is a good follow up to the first book. It's a short, entertaining read with some legitimately inspiring passages. If you loved the first book, spend the few dollars to snag this one. It's worth your time."

Attending Stargirl's solstice",08/10/2014,"I might as well add my voice to the chorus of people who loved this book.  A big improvement on the first (and not just in terms of length).  In this story we get to see the world from another character prospective, one that was fairly mysterious in the first book, owing much to the prospective given.  The cast are interesting and varied and there are some things done I didn't expect, but more on that later.As you probably already know, this book is written in the tense of a letter, which has been done before, but is done very well here.  I really enjoyed getting recaps of the day, sometimes weeks, after they happened.  What's better is that because this was written usually the end of a day, you could see the shifting and altering mindset of the character as she wrote the letter.  One thing that was done that was different and I loved was how the letter style is not constant.  Sometimes it's a summary and feels like a novel, sometimes it's random rambling and others it is broken up by poems and such.  It was pretty brilliant.The characters are also pretty spectacular, though I wish Stargirl had more friends  her age.  Actually the fact that she didn't might of been kind of the point, so I won't hold it at all against her (or the author).  The book is a lot longer than the original, which is great, but honestly I could of done with even more.  There are a lot of things this book started to touch on that I wish it had explored to greater depth.  Additionally I would like to have seen more about what stargirl thought about different things in life; However - the fact is the picture you are given is complete enough that I don't feel I need the author's hand holding to have a pretty good idea about how she would of reacted in different situations that the book doesn't present.There are some surprises and twists and turns I didn't expect and while the book is pretty generally a happy story, I think it improves on the already spectacular book one in just about every way.Oh and on the title of the review. . Read the book and you'll understand."

For me, Stargirl Represents the Desired Evolution of Humanity",14/10/2018,"In “Love, Stargirl”, the sequel to “Stargirl”, the main character’s family has already moved from Arizona to Pennsylvania where Stargirl returns to homeschooling after her short time in a real school in Arizona didn’t work out. In Arizona she was shunned by a mean mob of her peers for being a wonderful, positive role model.If humanity ever evolves into something better, we should learn from Stargirl. But, sad to think, there is only one Stargirl, and she is a fictional character in two books. Hopefully there will be a third book in the future.I read and reviewed “Stargirl” first before buying this sequel. The prequel earned five stars from me but this book is so much better because it is told from Stargirl’s point of view instead of Leo’s, the boy she left behind in Arizona after he dumped her. Of course, the reason he dumped her was because he caved in to peer pressure from a mean mob of other children who thought being too positive was wrong.I don’t think Stargirl is capable of a mean thought or behavior. After what Leo did to her in Arizona, how can she still love him like she does? To Stargirl, it seems Leo is her want-to-be Romeo and she is holding on to hope that he will evolve to her level. Is this wishful thinking? Unless there is a third book that includes Leo, we will never know.Stargirl is an incredible character and I want to know more about her life and friends. Because this book is told from her point of view, we meet all of the friends she makes in Pennsylvania: Dootsie, Betty Lou, Alvina, Perry Delloplane, and more. Each of Stargirl’s new friends is a unique individual as seen through the main characters eyes and thoughts. If we learn anything from the two books, we discover that being an individual is so much better than being the member of a mob of biased, like-minded people."

Excellent, but not quite as good as Stargirl.",31/05/2014,"You have to have read Stargirl, the first of the books, in order to understand Love, Stargirl.I was thinking it might be a good read for my fourth graders, but it is definitely too old for them.  Stargirl is a great story, and it is written in a fun way, but the content is much more suited to 8th graders and up.  The readability is fine for younger kids, but the subject is over their heads.A few of my students started Stargirl, but they lost interest.  Younger kids just don't get, and shouldn't get, the problems of high school kids.I loved the book, the story, and the creative way it is written, but wait 'til you're 14 to read it!I am now reading its sequal, which is not as good as Stargirl."

Magic",31/03/2011,"This review courtesy of Squeaky Clean Reads ([...])Overall Review:  Magic. That's what this book is full of: Magic.  How so? you might ask. There were no magic spells or magicians or incantations... No, there weren't, but there was magic nonetheless. There is magic in seeing the small and seemingly insignificant things going on around you. There is magic in taking joy in a moment or celebrating a day. And what is more magical than watching a transformation? A person becoming or overcoming? How about befriending a 6 year old? Did you know 6 year olds are magic? They are. An incredible magical journey to a Winter Solstice is made--where the magic brings people together who love each other because first they were loved.  In reference to the first book titled ""Stargirl"", written from the point of view of someone else, I heard tell of the disappointment of humanizing Stargirl in this volume.  Humanizing? Where? I beg to differ. What human can make that sort of magic happen? There are some humans out there like her, admittedly, but they are few and far between. We see them and always wonder, ""How do they do it?"" How?  Beautifully and poetically written.  Overall rating is 5 out of 5 stars!Content Review:VIOLENCE: one mild instancePROFANITY: few mild instancesSEXUAL CONTENT: NONEMATURE THEME: MildRECOMMENDED AGE GROUP:  14+A wonderfully written, squeaky clean book.  The only violent part is when a character gets angry and beats someone up.  It's not graphically written, but another character sees and is very shaken.  There are less than a handful of swear words--so unusual when writing about teenagers!  There is no sexual content (two characters kiss, but there's nothing sensual about it).  I considered this to have a mild mature theme only because of the thought provoking nature of the novel.  ""Love, Stargirl"" is a Squeaky Clean read for 14+!This review was written by EmilyA Squeaky Clean Reads Book Reviewer"

Sequel to Stargirl",03/02/2018,"This is the sequel to Stargirl, and it is written from the perspective of Stargirl herself.This story is written as a very long letter in the form of a series of diary entries. The letter is addressed to Leo, her ex-boyfriend from the first book.When I picked up this book, I wanted to know more about Stargirl. I wanted to know more about the ethereal and unique girl who sang happy birthday to strangers, who wore interestingly different clothes, and who seemed to have an endless amount of kindness.As I read this book, I realized that Stargirl, deep down was still a normal child. She experiences anger, heartbreak, disappointment and terror, like any other child. I also realized that the reason why many viewed her as such was because we were viewing her through the eyes of Leo, an eager, youngster who had fallen in love with Stargirl and viewed her through a certain lens.This book delves into Stagirl's everyday life: her homeschool activities, how she interacts with others, how she views others, her family, her ""milk runs"" with her father, and the inner workings of her mind. It's quite an interesting read, but the Stargirl you see here may be a different girl than the person you saw in Stagirl (the first book). Nevertheless, this is still an interesting read regarding a kind girl who celebrates her uniqueness and is willing to reach others."

Theme: Individuality vs. Conformity",26/02/2017,"The Stargirl series has been very popular in my special education classroom (5th-6th grade) this year.  One of my reading groups completed the Stargirl novel unit at the start of the school year and they requested that we read this one next because they weren't ready to say good-bye to the characters.  Cheers to Jerry Spinelli for creating a character who celebrates the uniqueness in all of us!

I love ""Love, Stargirl""!",02/05/2013,"This book is written in the form of a novel-length letter, over the course of year, to the boy who broke the eccentric home-schooler's heart. It follows (the self-named) Stargirl's acclimation to small town Pennsylvanian and the relationships she forges as she gets to know interesting people around her and herself.""Love, Stargirl"" is a sequel to the Spinelli's best-seller ""Stargirl"", which is referenced throughout the book. This works great if the two are read in reverse order (""Love, Stargirl"" and then ""Stargirl""). All the reminiscing is new to the uninitiated reader and builds intrigue about her past with  Leo and Mesa, AZ. The first book (""Stargirl"") -- the better written of the two -- then fills in the gaps, and provides a proper ending for the series.Endearing and well-written, it happens to feature -- and be accessible to -- teenage readers, without being dumbed down or condescending.All in all, great books. Highly recommended. But please please please read this one before the other one."

The mysteries of Stargirl are answered...",09/03/2011,"and it's sort of a shame that they are.Stargirl's appeal in the first, ""Stargirl,"" is her quirky, mysterious personality. The power of Stargirl lies in not understanding her quirky ideas and actions. This book answers too many questions to keep Stargirl that girl of mystery and independent womanhood.My main concern is the length of time she's stuck on Leo Borlock. The entire book is a letter to Leo and even after Stargirl is told repeatedly that she shouldn't live in the past and that she should get over Leo. She knows this. She UNDERSTANDS it, and yet, independent individual that she is, can't move on until the last two pages of the book. This goes against everything Stargirl is and is made to be in the first book. And also doesn't go very far in showing young girls the value of moving on after a tough relationship. Perhaps this is a normal teen girl response, but this normal response is exactly what makes it so anti-Stargirl.Which is not to say that the book isn't beautifully written, or that it's not filled with Stargirl's trademark quirks and Jerry Spinelli's incredible sense of humor.It just seems to be a forced sequel rather than an organic extension of a story..."

Love star girl",26/10/2020,I like how it was in the form of the letter and how some characters seemed like they were something tough in the beginning but with the help of star girl just being star girl they revealed how they actually were and not you they pretend to be. Sometimes I think we all need a star girl in our lives.

Where is my star girl",18/11/2018,This book makes me feel sad and happy at the same time. It comes from the fact that star girl is a special one of a king girl and she is so stuck on Leo. I believe this girl deserves her star boy and I hope it’s someoneElsewhere in her fictional world. I wish there was a third book where she meets her star boy. I guess it makes me more happy that sad. One of my favorites!

Excellent!",20/02/2007,"I very much enjoyed this book, the first of Ms. Picoult's that I've read. I must admit that the graphics sometimes disconcerted me, but that wasn't a huge deal.My enjoyment sprang from the relationships developed in the novel: father/daughter; wife/husband; mother/daughter; wife/affair partner; teenage girl/boyfriend; teenage girl/best friend. All of them got a good amount of attention and were fascinating to me. I especially loved learning the background of the father, the way he went from being a fairly milquetoast character to someone with far more depth and darkness. The daughter is similarly intriguing, especially since teenaged girls are often drawn very stereotypically. Ms. Picoult did a great job of making this young woman someone whose feelings and actions were understandable and sympathetic. In fact, perhaps there's one thing about the novel that really rings true for me and which guarantees my enjoyment: these characters are well-rounded: flawed and strong; victims and survivors; angry, hostile, and loving; cheaters and committed partners. Each one is a tiny world of motivations, desires, and actions.The only reason this is getting four stars from me instead of five is that I felt the ending was very abrupt. I kept expecting another chapter, but no--there wasn't one. Argh.Regardless--excellent!"

I wanted to love this book and admire the author's willingness to take risks",24/03/2006,"There is so much I love about Jodi Picoult's writing and I always look forward to each new book of hers. I was intrigued that this one combined traditional writing with parts that were portrayed in comic book form (she got an actual professional comic book artist to do the drawings and they are nicely done.  However, I found the story to be very convuluted and the premise (was a young girl raped? Or not?) to be unbelievable in the way it played out, taking the whole thing to court. The case was far from clear cut and there were all sorts of potentially incriminating circumstances (at least, from a jury's point of view).  Picoult's greatest strength is her ability to glean insights about human behavior and the darkest, most hidden parts of people...and then bring them to light. In that regard, she doesn't disappoint this time around. I was intrigued by each character, from Daniel, a man who spent a great deal of his life in Alaska and had a dark, troubled past...to his wife, Laura, a woman who'd been drawn to the rebel spirit in Daniel and then grew disappointed when he became more conventional.  At the heart of the book is Trixie Stone, the 14 year old daughter of Daniel and Laura, a teen who may or may not have been raped by her ex-boyfriend. I believe  Picoult skillfully portrayed all the emotional highs and lows of today's 14 year old girls, half women, half girls...and growing up far too fast. I felt for Trixie and parts of the book were almost too painful to read as her heartbreak and pain shone through so clearly.  Where the book failed me was in the plot which veered and teetered close to soap opera material. There were just too many ""over the top"" moments and that's when I started to lose interest. I found myself saying, ""Oh, come on!"" with each moment of high drama, from suicide attempts to screaming at a funeral. There were far more moments like that and I didn't find them believable. I couldn't help contrasting this with other of Picoult's books (Her Sister's Keeper, for instance), books which stayed much more true to form.  While I always finish Picoult's books (for, even at her worst, she is very, very good in fleshing out characters and gleaning insights about human behavior) I was hoping that she'd create a tale that seemed believable in both tone and plot.  This one did not. Still, she gets kudos for taking risks, for combining comic book form with straight narrative and for making comparisons to Dante's Inferno in much of the situations. This time, however, she just couldn't seem to pull all the various parts together...but she came very, very close.  I'll be looking forward to her next book, just as I have so many others of hers."

A must read",16/01/2018,"When you read Jodi Picoult's work, you enter a world filled with knowledge, caring, support and more. She is an excellent author. Her characters are well developed and her storyline is well written and read. You will be on the edge of your chair and, at the same time, relaxed. Jodi's one who gets your attention from the first page and never loses it. You are so engrossed in the book that you can't stop reading. On the other hand, you love her writing because it is so well done. After I finish reading one of Jodi's books, it's very hard for me to start another book until the next day. I am still thinking about the story.This book was another well written book. Here you will learn about love of family, self doubt, teenage pranks, and more. You will learn how a person can go from innocence to an adult in the flicker of an eye. You will learn coping mechanisms to help you deal with life's handouts.This book is about a small family who all have doubts. Don't we all? Their doubts affect each and every one of the family as well as the people they interact with. Don't our doubts do that? Well, this book beautifully shows us how to see and feel what others see and feel. When a father is the main caretaker of his child, his doubts come forth as you have never seen them before. The mother has her insecurities and doubts and this affects her husband and daughter.Survival is the key. How do you survive with life's cruelties? Our lives are filled with choices. Each time we make a choice, it affects others. Survive.Pick up a copy."

Stay strong, be together, learn your kids, so worth the read!",30/01/2016,"Loved this book, as with all of her others. She's a true storyteller who doesn't just give you a scene or an incident, but all sides of it and then some. The graphic novels were gorgeously interwoven too. Aside from review of writing style or content, I'm not a parent, but I would encourage parents to read this book. What she writes about is happening. She talked to the kids and knows, first hand. I know what I was like, and can only imagine that it actually has gotten this bad. Also something for strength in marriage and commitment, which is something we need to see in this world right now. Overall, exactly what I want from a novel. Hard to digest the facts of life and transgressions of the characters, but when they do, I do too."

Good but not her best",30/09/2015,"The first Picoult book I read was Nineteen Minutes and I have found that nothing since then comes close. But this book was very good and once again Picoult does an excellent job of exploring complicated topics - the sexual awakening of a teenage girl and date rape. Unlike other books by Picoult, the characters here are not that well developed and the father's character in particular lacks dimension. He is depicted as a having undergone a huge transformation in lifestyle and personality but this is left largely unexplored.  Likewise the character of the mother is almost one dimensional, but the main character, Trixie, is compelling. The story, like Picoult's other works, is thought provoking and gave me new perspectives on issues I thought I had long ago worked out."

Bit Too Melodramatic For My Tastes",29/08/2007,"This is hard for me because as much as I loathed certain aspects of this book, I couldn't put it down.  Despite my best efforts, I got sucked in and had to know what happened next.  That says something, doesn't it?Okay, the premise ... turn on Lifetime or an after school special and you'll get the same kind of story.  I won't spoil anything about the book, but Picoult managed to throw in every possible trauma a family could go through in an amazingly short span and then make sure we learned our lessons by practically beating us over the head.  But, perhaps such escalation of eccentric plot devices was the point.  The mother of her main character is a specialist in Dante's Inferno, and so part of me wonders if this story is supposed to mirror the nine levels of hell, but if so, I think it was done rather melodramatically.One interesting tool used in this book, however, is actual comic book pages ""drawn"" by the main character's father who is a renowned comic book artist.  Shocker, the comic book is called The Tenth Circle as well.  At the end of each chapter are components that make up a larger comic book, which parallel the actual story and play off of Dante's Inferno.  I'll admit, Picoult had some impressive concepts going in this book; I simply didn't care for her style of execution.Listen, I know a lot of people really like this book and love Jodi Picoult, and I can't deny the fact that I could not stop reading.  I slapped my forehead the whole way through as the plot got more and more outlandish, but I couldn't stop reading.  If an author can keep you going even when you don't want to, they're obviously doing something right.If you're into Picoult, you'll probably dig this.  As for me, as good as she was at hooking me, this'll probably be the last book of hers I read.  Just a tad too heavy on the family drama and forced ""life lessons"" for my tastes.~Scott William Foley, author of

the girl who cried wolf",28/03/2007,"Like most Picoult books, ""The Tenth Circle"" is the story of a family in crisis and how it strains the bonds between members.  It also follows the pattern of one character making a confession that results in a court case (or a build up to one), then peters out when the confession turns out to be not what it appears, and then the plot veers off in another direction entirely.  This, I suppose, is meant to avoid the book being ""predictable,"" but once you know the pattern, the unpredictability becomes predictable.  This worked better in her newest ""Nineteen Minutes."" This time around the confession centers around the 14-year-old daughter's allegation that she was  raped at a party by her boyfriend.  Her peers believe she is lying to get back at the boyfriend for having dumped her, and the evidence is inconclusive.  Her crisis triggers guilt in her father, a comic book artist with a troubled past, who blames himself for missing the signs that his daughter was in trouble.  Her mother also feels likewise guilty.  As the trial approaches, Trixie's mental health deteriorates and soon the original crime is compounded when a family member seeks revenge on the boy. As usual the relationship between the father and daughter is well drawn, and the depiction of teenagers is frighteningly true to life.  However, the book lost focus halfway through, and the author didn't seem to know what to do with Laura, the mother character.  Her guilt could have added more depth to the family dynamics if it had been less one dimensional, instead she practically wore a scarlet ""A.""  I enjoyed the part that took place in Alaska, however, I felt that the story could have been tightened without detracting from the drama. For a better look at the aftermath of teen rape, read ""Speak"" by Laurie Halse Anderson."

A WILD BUT UNEVEN RIDE",12/03/2006,"Jodi Picoult is a marvelously skillful writer, and in the past I have been enthralled by her creative, unusual plotting, insight on family relationships and vivid characters. THE TENTH CIRCLE is chock full of unusual elements (I loved the graphic novel comics), symbolism (loved the Dante too) and atmosphere (I really enjoyed the descriptions of Alaskan life).  That said, I have never felt so let down by a Picoult novel.  It's like she is attempting to tell too many stories at once, on too many fronts, and letting us down sadly in the end.  But what bothered me most was the moral ambiguity. Are we simply supposed to be shocked, or are we supposed to care? In an attempt to over-empathize with the young heroine, her boyfriend is not only depicted VERY unrealistically as a kind of beast in a situation no teenage boy I can imagine would have handled much differently, but is cruelly made a victim himself. Usually I enjoy the probing questions Picoult poses,  but here questions proliferate like mushrooms and do not compensate for the lack of satisfying answers.  Picoult's intensity and pacing kept me turning those pages, but by the last section of the book I felt ripped off and manipulated.  She teased, also, with certain important questions that were left unanswered or confused.  Like too much rich food, the reader is left feeling stuffed but unsatisfied."

This is a grueling novel about coming of age for a 14 year old girl.",21/01/2022,"I disliked the detailed descriptions of the young disappointed girl cutting her arms with an x-acto blade.  Someone in my family has done the same thing for similar reasons....disappointment, depression and isolation in teenhood.  I put the book out for recycle to a Goodwill or other store as we have enough disappointment and isolation from the pandemic.  Maybe if I had tried to read it at another point in life I might have finished it. It was too painful to read that young people would disfigure themselves over being dumped romantically.  We've ALL been there and did not have to disfigure ourselves.  Sorry Jodi I normally LOVE your writing genre and command of the English language.  Not this book though."

but I enjoyed it just the same",20/11/2014,"This was different than Picoult's other novels, but I enjoyed it just the same. It was more intellectual, with the mother being a college professor, and an ongoing allegory/comic strip based on Dante's Inferno. I needed to put on reading glasses to see the comic strip letters, but it seemed like others had a hard time reading it as well. Other than that, I found the novel gripping and finished it quickly. The protagonist, Trixie, and her father Daniel are fully drawn. The mother is a little more shadowy. The plot keeps twisting as Trixie gets raped (or did she?), and something unexpected happens to the rapist (or did it?). The ending is a little uncertain, but you can figure out what happens. I also enjoyed learning more about Alaskan culture."

Not as I expected.",12/06/2006,"I will start, as most do, by professing my love for Picoult's books. They really get the wheels turning and make you think about things. But this one just didn't do it for me. I've bought every single one of her books, no questions asked, without even reading what its about. This is the 3rd time I've been a bit disappointed.(my other non-favorites were second glance and vanishing act).  I was intrigued by the whole dante's inferno thing. I liked the comics. But all in all, it was not a fast read and I found myself bored with it at times. I'm starting to think Picoult is just cranking them out to get them out, not to write an astounding book. Most of her other books seemed to be carefully crafted, but the last few...leave me wanting more. I would say go grab ""my sister's keeper"" or ""mercy"" over this one any day."

Ehh..Not my cup of tea.",25/01/2011,"Well, since this is a more recent book from Jodi Picoult, I pressed purchase before I ever read the storyline. I thought it would be interesting because the subject is a teen, and I'm a teen so I thought that I would be able to relate to the book.I started reading it and found it a bit boring, but as the story went on, it got more interesting. Then, the story started to drag; I felt like the fact that the mom having an affair with her student was too far fetched. I also found all the comics annoying as I'm trying to read a book about a teen and her struggle with being raped, not reading an action comic book. So, I just skipped over those parts of the book.I found the ending to be a big let down, but at least we know what happened in the end.I wouldn't read it again, but I might consider suggesting it to one of my teen friends."

Surprisingly Good...",09/07/2014,"The path that led me to reading this book is a strange one.  Apart from the premise, I knew precisely squat about this book or the author, Jodi Picoult.  But I was overwhelmingly surprised.  This was a very good book and I will be on the lookout for more of Picoult's work.  I'm always a fan when there's a female protagonist, and one in law enforcement is only a bonus.  Delia Hopkins is smart, feisty, caring, and sharp as a tack.  Even when her idyllic life in New Hampshire is shattered by the revelation that her name isn't Delia and that, while being her biological parent, her father had taken her from her mother in Arizona when she was a little girl, violating a custody agreement with his ex-wife.  With her father headed back to Arizona to stand trial for kidnapping, Delia and her daughter follow him while her fiancée, a lawyer, takes his case with the aide of a local friend.  The centerpiece of the trial becomes Delia's memories of a past she always thought she was only imagining.  All the while, her father sits in the county jail, with a cell mate who's career in the free world is a meth dealer/cook.  This book is often sold as an exploration of memories.  With this sort of marketing strategy, I always fear the possibility that the central element of the plot will overshadow everything else.  This thankfully was not the case.  The exploration of memories, specifically Delia's memories, was nicely integrated and it was all more interesting as a result.  This book was interesting across the board.  The characters, many of them trading off narrating duties, were all well-developed.  The scene descriptions of New Hampshire and Arizona were all breath-taking...I totally want to visit these places.  Best of all, this unabridged audio book had a different voice actor every time a different character took over as the narrator.  That alone was absolutely great as it gave even more life to these characters, many of whom I was already willing to sit down with for coffee.  For all these elements and more, I absolutely recommend this book and I'm convinced that Jodi Picoult is just as great in her other works.  Enjoy."

""Recollections are in the eyes of the beholder.""",29/03/2005,"Cordelia Hopkins makes a living finding lost people. She and her beautiful bloodhound, Greta, have a terrific track record for leading successful search-and-rescue missions. They're very good at what they do. As ""Vanishing Acts"" progresses, it becomes obvious that Delia has had an unusually intense interest in loss, of both people and memory, stemming from her third year of life.Raised by her warm and loving father, Andrew, Delia had as happy a childhood as anyone could wish for. Her dad, a widower, was always right there for her. She could talk to him about anything...and she still can, she believes. Sometimes, she would think about what it would be like to have a mother and fantasize about meeting her in heaven. Her mom died in a car crash when she was a small child. On the other hand, it seems to Cordelia that she and her father have lived forever in the same cozy house in rural New Hampshire, just the two of them. He has run a local senior center there for as long as she can remember, and has always been active in community affairs. Although she has vague memories of a woman who smelled of vanilla and apples, Delia remembers almost nothing of her life prior to Wexton, NH.Her two next door neighbors are her two best friends and have been for most of her thirty-two years. She grew up with both of them. Eric Talcott, her fiance, is the father of her pre-school daughter, Sophie. They are in the process of planning their wedding. Fitzwilliam MacMurray, (Fitz), formed the other part of their triumvirate from the time they were little kids. They were a ""fungible"" trio, as Fitz once put it. In high school, when Eric and Delia fell in love, the three-way friendship continued and still does, years later.  Eric is now a lawyer, and Fitz a journalist.As Sophie grows from a toddler to little girl, Delia begins to remember more about her own life at her daughter's age. Images, sounds, the feel of the sun on her head, bring back fragmented memories from another time - people, voices and a place she just cannot identify. Then one evening a policeman knocks on the door with a warrant for her father's arrest, and her life and world are turned upside down.""Vanishing Act"" is written in the first person by each of five main characters: Delia, Andrew, Eric, Fitz, and  Elise. Each point of view provides part of the puzzle that is the history of the Hopkins' family. I am a big fan of the author's and have never disliked any of her novels. There are some books by Jodi Picoult which I love, and others I would prefer not to read twice. ""Vanishing Acts"" is in the latter category, and is probably the book I like least by Ms. Picoult. The narrative feels forced, even erratic at times, and disturbs the natural flow which usually marks the author's work. She has added unwarranted drama, which fits neither the storyline nor the characters. There are scenes from prison life that, although fascinating, are tremendously distracting and excessively violent - to no purpose. Certain characters, dialogue and scenarios are just out of place and make an otherwise believable plot incredible. Unnecessary touches, like change of font and the use of boldface type to distinguish between characters' stories and chapters, are also awkward. It is as if the author could not count on the strength of her plot and storytelling ability to sustain the novel, and needed to go for the artsy effect to provide a worthy result.On the other hand, there are people who surface here, like the Native American woman, Ruthann, who is a jewel of a character - and a prime example of what Jodi Picoult fans look for when we purchase her novels without a second's thought. I am glad I read the book. I would have been sorry to miss it. However, read parts of it in a bookstore before you decide to make a purchase. Otherwise, wait for it to come out in paperback or go to the library.JANA"

She can write about real life family situations with such a reality you feel the characters.This about a child who is ""kidnapped"" by her father and does not know about it until 28 years later when he is arrested for the crime.It delves into her life now, before and after.  There are so many lies and situations that are hard to comprehend.Ms Picoult writes from everybodys perspective.  The daughter, father, mother, lawyer, boyfriend,lover, grandchild. They all play a part and have their story.  You learn about the courtroom procedure and how one survives prison and many other unbelievable and real situations.Once again, I loved a Jodi Picoult book.

Good Story Line",28/06/2013,"I really liked the story line of this novel. I think Jodi Picoult takes controversial issues and attacks them from all angles. In this case, the reasons a father would kidnap his daughter from her custodial mother and then change their identities and keep it a secret from her for 28 years. I feel kind of bad criticizing the author, but I have noticed that of the Jodi Picoult novels I've read, her style almost never changes.  She duplicates names from novel to novel - for example, how many people named ""Fitz"" have you ever met, yet I've come across characters in two of her books with that name.  And the fact that she tells the story from up to 6 different characters point of view (each character's narration is a different typeface also) and it tends to be confusing. Jodi is a very intelligent woman (just read her bio) who has a masters degree and has been educated at the likes of Harvard and Princeton - which is great, but I tend to zone out sometimes because I don't always understand what she is talking about.  Her characters tend to have unusual hobbies and she goes into detail explaining what they're thinking (such as how stars come to be or what the Greek gods have done or in one case, the history of the Hopi Indians) which usually has little to do with the story line.  Also, she tends to make the characters a bit unreal by having them always say things that are really out there (an example is when Delia's thoughts were something to the effect of if she touched the sky and the desert with a pin, the air would be let out of everything in the world - what????!!!!)  None of these things would keep from reading Jodi's books and they may not even bother other readers.  I read a lot of books by a lot of authors, and it's hard not to compare the styles that you may like better or form your own opinions about the stories or authors.  All in all, I would recommend this book.  It was a good read, and as always, these are my own opinions and you may think differently."

Wish I could rate NO stars",08/08/2010,"The most frustrating thing to me about Jodi Picoult is how she comes up with such great concepts, and has a basically nice writing style that is easy to get hooked into. Then she proceeds to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, trying to show us how clever she is, how much research she's done, how many characters she can juggle and have them all somehow magically provide just the perfect insight to one another that they needed. I've now read several of her books, because I keep wanting to give her another chance, but this is it for me.Here are some of the worst faults of this book: First off, the use of alternating points of view, complete with different fonts as a visual aid. But then the voices themselves are all completely identical - the overly poetic, self-important voice of the all-knowing writer. Why bother to use this device at all if you can't make it more convincing that we're actually getting inside the heads of the different characters?Then, the excessively long sections about life in prison, complete with gangs, nicknames, ridiculous Latino and Black dialogue, and jailhouse poetry... oh, come ON!! I was actually embarrassed for Picoult the first time that awful rap appeared, and then she just couldn't help herself, she did it again. I literally could not bring myself to read more than a few lines, and finally just had to skip the rest of the prison sections altogether.***SPOILERS***Just when I'd had about enough of the quirky Native American neighbor, Ruthann, she actually takes Delia and Sophie off on a road trip with her to the Hopi Reservation. And when she jumps to her death from the ancient cliff dwellings, we get Delia, in her rampant conceit, believing that Ruthann purposely brought her along because she knew Delia and her bloodhound would be able to track her and somehow 'bear witness' to her suicide.Then, oops! Eric starts drinking again, and Delia falls into bed with Fritz (except it's the back seat of her car, just emphasizing how adolescent this whole triangle really is). But WAIT! Eric is actually okay with it, but still somehow expects Delia to come back to him when he gets straightened out, yet again.Finally, there it is, the characteristic Picoult twist at the end: Andrew drops the bombshell in court that Victor was abusing his daughter... no wait! It's a double twist! Delia starts to remember the abuse herself... no, it's a triple twist!... Andrew admits to her that he might not have even seen anything at all, but only convinced himself of it based on his suspicions...I could go on and on, there is so much to dislike about this book. Just read all of the other 1-star reviews, I agree with everything they said!"

Raises Many Issues, Legal and Moral",16/03/2020,I just read some past reviews of this book which were pretty scathing.  I can’t believe we read the same book. I can overlook flaws in writing if the story and characters grab me.Yes the story was a little disjointed and perhaps padded with extraneous sections. But I think the author was making a point about prison conditions although Andrew did take on Walter White qualities. But you do what you have to in order to survive. I found the Hopi culture sections interesting. Author also making a statement on repressed memory.

Pretty Good... First timer",02/03/2006,"I definitely think that Jodi Picolt is an amazing and inspirational author.  Her writing is so vivid and her characters come alive.  Vanishing Acts is the first book that I've read by Picolt and I have to say it will not be the last.  While it seems at times that the story is in different places and all over, it all comes together at the end.  My only thing is that I like closure - since it is a novel and I won't ever get to know how the story really ends!  No spoilers here, but I wish I knew a little bit more of what really happens to everyone after all is said and done."

An Amazing Journey",23/08/2023,"I believe Gary Jennings must be an alien.  How one human being can write with the level of detail and brilliance over subjects as varied as Aztec and the Journeyer (and others) is beyond my comprehension.  I just get lost in the adventure, humor, violence, sex and history all amplified and mashed up in a crazed hypnotic mosaic.  Not for the faint of heart or easily offended and definitely geared towards the male mindset.  My greatest wish is that the Jennings' estate would allow these masterworks to be adopted to audiobooks -- having listened to Lonesome Dove and the Stand on audio, these massive works would not suffer and would permit me to commute with a big damn smile on my face.  For months."

Excellent Story-Telling",20/12/2005,"As a student of Mexican history, an aspiring writer and a linguist by education, I'm possibly among the tougher readers out there. As a matter of fact, I rated the sequel to this book at 1 star out of 5... :)So here is my opinion, take it or leave it. I believe this work deserves the highest mark.Key Positives:- Specific, visual writing style that leaves no doubt about what the writer is saying. The quality of writing is well above average: the words are chosen with care, the scenes are complete, the text is easy to read. G. Jennings immediately created the 'style' of the book, unique and engaging.- Compelling main character. Mixtli is a joy to get to know. He's one of the richest literary personages that I know of. The insights into his nature are deep and disturbing.- Breadth of research and excellent presentation of it. The sites, smells, sensations of the time are reproduced with outstanding level of detail.- ""Show don't tell"" excellence: I forgot about time... the book is so visually and sensually compelling that at times I had an impression of watching a movie rather than reading a book. Or having a dream...- Tight plot. Some folks seem to expect a fast-moving plot from this book which is probably a 'milieu' (location) book rather than a commercial, event-driven story. The plot is the life itself. Every scene is in its place. Even the most disgusting scenes move the plot forward in more than one way. Superb planning and execution!- Honesty and bravery in covering even the most unpleasant details.Key Negatives:- Some characters do get repetitive. All the key women are coockie-cut: stunning beauties of unbelievable grace, who drench Mixtli in their generous unconditional love, etc. Everyone apart from his daughter (thanks goodness not his daughter) worships his member and indulges into the most questionable behaviour with him from incest to pedophilia.- Some historical data is plain wrong. The flow of conquest is distorted, the character of Montezuma, in fact rich and well-documented, is made into a cartoon junkie, Dona Marina is artificial, etc. I guess that's the 'right of pen' in action... but it does undermine credibility of the rest of the facts. Which, probably, is fine.- I'm sorry, but the compulsive obsession with how every woman's 'tipili' looks and feels, and with Mixtli's own manhood size is tiring. I've done my share of wild things in life, but even I thought it too much.Overall, a delightful book. It affected me deeply, and possibly changed me. How many books have done this to you?Cheers."

Makes you shudder and smile...",10/05/2000,"First of all, undeniable praise goes to author's talent for recreation of the world long gone: besides Aztecs themselves, all those tribes and peoples, with names difficult to pronounce and their ways and traditions,  mostly repulsive and hardly believable.  I'd have liked to know how much of  the story has been fruit of Mr. Jenning's brilliant imagination, and what  has been based on research.  To follow narrator's - Mixtil's - fascinating  story is easy, but sad to acknowledged, I finished this book with no regret  that this civilization has vanished. First of all, it reached its peak and  was ripe for defeat and conquest, second, and more important, however much  blood was shed in the name of Christianity and European civilization, rites  of Aztec to 99% are abominable to understanding of a modern and medieval  person alike. Author's merit is that he does not only graphically and  grisly describes them, but also explains why they were performed, what  religious belief led to them. Still such civilization did not stir no  sympathy or understanding in me. However, author's sense of humor, acid  scorn or subtle remarks, pronounced by Mixtil, whether it concerned Aztec's  ways, human stupidity or Spanish concistadors, are amazingly to the  point.The book also proves that human joys and misery are always the same.  Enjoy this book, even if it makes you shudder every second page...what  remains after you finishthe book, is its humour and bloody imprints in your  memory."

Time in Another World",21/05/2011,"This is one of the most engaging books I have read in many years. It is the story of a (fictional) Aztec who testifies about his life before a panel of priests who record the tales for their king in Spain. The details about the experiences of the narrator are only exceeded by the wonderful descriptions of how the people of that time in Central Mexico may have lived. The historical associations are extremely informative even if they are not all based on fact. One truly gets the sense of what life may have been in that part of the world before the arrival of Cortes and the end of the Aztec empire.  The narrator himself is an interesting character. His scruples and values often fluctuate but he is a person of his time. His adventures enable the author to speculate about the surrounding tribal areas, the sexual behavior (there is plenty of this-some of which is hard to take as is the abundance of violence in the wars and ceremonies which are described) and the values of the civilizations he touches. He is a proud, highly achieving, adventurous man whose life is full of important and interesting encounters which occasionally are rather hard to identify with but which offer an entree into the life of the Aztec area. His cleverness is beautifully demonstrated by his comments about the Church of the priest/recorders and the similar values the ""barbaric"" Aztecs have with the ""holy messengers of Jesus"" and the Spanish church. There is subtle and often biting sarcasm injected into his story telling (almost Swiftian in quality.)  The book is 750 pages long, full of action and clever observation. It is not an easy read but the narrative flows smoothly and the writing is outstanding. I enjoyed the book so much, I felt empty when it ended for me. It will be a treat for any fan of history or of good writing. Although this is a work of fiction, the research that went into it makes it quite informative as well. I highly recommend it."

my favorite book of all time, a must read",21/04/2018,"Gary Jenning's Aztec is my favorite book of all time. I first read it about a decade ago, and have reread it numerous time since, and it gets better every time. I recommend it to everyone looking for a book recommendation and I have bought several copies to gift to people. The story is epic, beautiful spun, and easy to read (well, except for maybe the bits written in the voice of the priest, those can be pretty verbose with some impressive vocabulary). Its an exciting page turner about the entire life of the main character Mixtli, ranging from his young childhood to his old age while also informing the reader about many aspects of Aztec life and it was well- researched and historically accurate.One thing to note is that this is not a standard sized paperback - its a rather long book, but well worth it. If you like long epic stories definitely give this one a tryOne word of caution, there is a lot of blood, sex and violence in this book, so if you are easily offended it might not be for you, but if you love that stuff you'll love this book. I'd say its a ""Game of Thrones"" level of sex and violence"

Good Historical Fiction",12/08/2021,"The Aztecs were the ancestors of Mexico and were the dominant culture in Central American when the Spanish arrived in the 1500s.  Cortez with only a handful of Spanish soldiers (with muskets) miraculously defeated the massive Aztec army and established Spanish dominance. The arrival (and victory) of the invaders had been long predicted by Aztec religious prophets, so they pretty much gave-up without much of a fight.When the dust of the invasion had settled, Spanish missionaries went to work attempting to convert all the natives to Christianity.In the book.....In addition to the spoils of war (cargo ships full of gold and treasure) and the massive Christian conversion, the Spanish king also wants an in-depth history of Aztec culture, so he commissions the head bishop assigned at Tenochtitlan (Mexico City) to find someone capable of telling the Aztec story. They locate a wealthy, well-travelled merchant (who had also been a soldier, explorer and an advisor to the former Aztec king). His life story, written as briefing papers to the king, are the basis of this book. By telling his story, the merchant pretty much lays out the entire history of the Aztecs, as well as all of Central and South America.The book is very, VERY long, so plan on spending some time with it.  If you like history, though, it’s  worth the long read."

Good historical fiction",15/11/2007,"My Uncle recommended this book to me. It's historical fiction about the Aztec  Empire, specifically about one Aztec, Mixtli, who lives in the last decades before the Spanish conquest and the ultimate fall of the Aztec civilization. The story is transcribed by priests from interviews with Mixtli, and interspersed with letters reporting back to the King of Spain, who has taken a great interest in the exploits of this ""savage.""Mixtli is a kind of Forrest Gump of the Aztecs, an adventurer of folkloric proportions, experiencing the history and geography of ""The One World"" often the benefactor of good timing and good fortune. As he makes his way up through the ranks, from scribe to warrior to trader, etc., we get an in-depth look at Aztec culture: it's religious beliefs, violent sacrifices, everyday life, politics, wars, and social structures.What struck me about the book overall was how light and comedic it felt for historical fiction. Whether this undercuts the serious ""history lesson"" aspect of it is hard to say. Possibly. But at 1038 pages, it's a welcome addition. It took me a long time to get through this dense book, and I put it down from time to time to read something else, but I was never bored by the story.Aztec is an epic adventure, an informative and well-researched history lesson, and a good story overall. My one complaint is that the gratuitous sex got old after awhile. It's not a puritanical critique--I just kept feeling like, yeah, yeah, then he gets another chick. And I'd flip ahead a few pages. But otherwise, pretty good."

Mesmirizing and mystifying masterpiece",20/08/2001,"This jewel is NOT to be read by the weak-hearted. This is really a man's book because so much of what the characters think, say, and do make you ask yourself, ""Did this guy read my mind?!""  Jennings is the Michaelangelo of storytellers.  His attention to details, even the most bloody and gory ones, make this book a must read for anyone interested in the history of Mexico and the indigenous indians that populated it.  Parts of it are very humorous, parts are gruesome, parts are appalling, parts will make you cry, many parts will make you angry, parts are very sensual and sexually graphic and all of it is the utmost of entertaining.  Like it or not, Jennigs tells it like it is.  My favorite characters were Beu Rebe and Armed Scorpion.  I just loved Zyana. The most despised were Hernan Cortez, Mocteczuma, and the dispicable Zumarraga. This book is loaded with ""good stuff"" so what ever you do, don't try to speed read it.  Slowly savor each exciting part.  Don't try to figure any character out.  Laugh at ""Offal of the God's"".  Wretch at ""Jaded Princess"".  Marvel at ""Armed Scorpion"".  Sympathize with Beu Rebe.  You will fall in love with this book.  It will occupy your mind and make you pledge to ourself that a visit to Mexico is something you must do before you die.  The magnificence of that civilization is impossible to comprehend.  Then pick up a copy of the sequel ""Aztec Autumn"".  That jewel I will review another time!

lost civilization come alive",08/06/2008,"I read this excellent novel years ago and still remember its impact on me.  I was entranced by Jennings' descriptions of peoples and empires long gone.  His device of using a traveling merchant--pocheca--as his primary character was excellent.  It gave Jennings the opportunity to take the reader to places and peoples distant from the capital in Tenochtitlan.  His description of war, religion and human sacrifice is wonderful and reflects the obvious fact that Jennings carefully researched the subject.I especially remember the merchant's horror to find that his daughter had, without his knowledge, been offered up to the horrific Flayed God, Xipe Totec.  He sees her in the form of a bloody skin worn by a dancing priest.  Here I must mention that there are revisionists who deny that these things--wholesale human sacrifice--actually happened in ancient Mexico--that they were inventions of the rapacious Spaniards to justify their conquest.  I can remember visiting the National Museum in Mexico City where you can see Aztec ceremonial bowls used to hold human hearts; chacmools used for the same purpose; sacrificial knives; and even an effigy of Xipe Totec wearing a human skin like a garment.  Nowhere, however, was there a mention of human sacrifice.  Political correctness.  Political stupidity.In writing my own novels, ""Skull Rack"" and ""Hummingbird God"", on the Conquest of Mexico from the Spanish perspective, I'm delighted to say I was decidedly politically INCORRECT.Ron Braithwaite"

There is no way you will ever regret reading this book.",15/06/2016,"Excellent! Gary Jennings' novel Aztec sets the standard for which all historical fiction should be measured. It is a very long book, but is so entertaining and educational. Most people will read through it rather quickly just because it's such a good book, a real page-turner. This is the book you want to read if you want to learn about the Aztecs without even trying. The story is wonderful and so immersive. It follows the life of Mixtli, an old Aztec man who is compelled by Spanish missionaries to tell the story of his life and the lives of the Aztec, so that missionaries can record it on paper and send the transcripts to the king of Spain, per the King's request. As Mixtli tells the story, you see him go from a child born to unremarkable parents to ultimately becoming among the greatest warriors of the Aztec council, until he describes the fall of the Aztecs with the arrival of Cortez from Spain. So you get an engrossing history lesson on the rise and fall of the Aztecs, and a rich story of one man's triumphs and tragedies, all of which land him in the inquisitor's chair. There is no way you will ever regret reading this book."

A compelling, engrossing, phenomenal read ...",07/02/2008,"A one-time Mexicatl nobleman named Tliléctic-Mixtli, or Dark Cloud, relates the history of his people (aka Aztecs) after the capture of Technótitlan by Hernán Cortés. It is 1529 when the story opens and 1531 when it ends. It takes almost 2 years (and 1,000+ pages) to tell of the life and experiences of the Aztec Mixtli, who served at one time or another as mapmaker, traveling merchant, historian, spy, warrior and nobleman.Because Mixtli is narrator, we learn of the history and demise of the Aztec people from their point of view. It isn't until the last 100 pages that the invasion and diseases, which kill off the Aztecs, occur. Thus, the book is rich with the social, political and economic history of the people.Because Mixtli relates his story to the bishops that serve the king of Spain, and because these bishops reveal their ignorance and prejudices through their letters to the king, we receive the viewpoint of the victors as well. The communication gap is phenomenal, vivid and heart-wrenching.Aztec is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have been reading for more years than I care to reveal. I've read it twice. It's epic historical fiction with empathetic characters, romance, and the ups and downs of human life.An unqualified 5-star recommendation!"

Of every book I've ever read, this one left me with the most severe feeling of ""what am I going to do now?"" when I finished it.  I've bought over a dozen copies for others, over the years, because I wanted to expand the circle of people with whom I could discuss this story.

Badly written Aztec Forrest Gump",22/12/2020,"I have three complaints about this book:1) The writing is just awful. It’s belabored, inelegant and just frankly boring. I commend the author for his perseverance in research and laboring through penning 750 pages. But not a single phrase, sentence or paragraph struck me as even mildly evocative or inspiring. It’s the writing of a 15 year old.2) Its a lazy “Forest Gump” trope in Aztec disguise. By that I mean the protagonist meanders or happens or blunders through all kinds of dramatic episodes that really are just plot devices. Again, it’s lazy storytelling and writing. There is no “force” in the main character. He is also weak of eyesight which again was a needless story arc that also weakens the credibility of future escapades.3) It is needlessly long. I am more than happy to work through a 700+ page book as long as there is some value in it - whether the writing, or moving characters or a compelling story. This has neither. Many of the divergent storylines don’t add to the experience in anyway.I had to give it one star so I could write this review.I added a star because of the historical research and narrative.This could be a far better read if some charitable “editor” would take it upon herself to rewrite it, cut out the unnecessary fluff (5 pages about how he wishes he had told his wife he loved her sooner? And none of them moving or well written!), and shorten it to maybe 400 pages."

Best book ever written!",27/02/2009,"My wife had this book in her little ""library"".  Her last boyfriend before we met gave it to her as a gift since she was Mexican.  She's not much of a reader and just put it aside.  I saw the book in the house, but had never heard of it, and it was really long, so I never bothered to read it.  Well 10 years later I was bored and looking for something to read around the house.  I found the book again and decided what the heck, I'll check it out.  I'm glad I did, because it is THE best book ever written.  Most people, myself included, have no idea how advanced the Aztec civilization was before the Spanish came.  Yes they were brutal, but advanced in many ways.Gary Jennings, the author, a white guy from Virginia, moved to Mexico for 12 years doing research before writing this book.  I did not know it was a historical novel with many truthful events until after reading it.  I reccommend this book to anyone who likes to read.  Once you start, you can't stop.

As usual, there are several story lines to follow, which meet up at the concluding Abbey feast: the pathetic and delusional High Queen Slith, mother of the seven marauding Marlfoxes, and brooding about Marl Castle on an island in Hidden Lake; three young Abbey dwellers who steal off in the night to redeem themselves by rescuing the stolen Redwall tapestry; the Abbey dwellers and their Dibbuns, fighting off the Marlfoxes and their army of verminI thought all of the story lines were interesting and well written.  Sometimes when you read a book like this you get attached to one story line and hurry through lesser tales until you get to the characters you really like, but in this book I really enjoyed all of the characters and their adventures.  The ending was satisfying, and the descriptions of the feasts were, as usual, hunger-inducing."

Classic",24/01/2014,"Brian Jacques has always worked best with visualizations. I read this book first in 2nd or 3rd grade, and it has a lot of particularly strong visual images that stuck with me throughout the years. Re-reading it, I found the characters a little flat (with nearly 9 different villains, its hard to characterize them all), the motivations sometimes feeling very bare-bones, and in general leaving you wanting to know just a little bit more about the players involved. Ultimately, though, I really enjoyed the story for what it was: a fun, exciting, and interesting tale that I could enjoy at face value."

Great Series!",22/01/2016,"The Redwall series of books is well written and perfect for both young and young-at-heart readers. It’s a fantasy set full of adventures of good versus evil, coming of age, finding bravery and friendship, reveling in poetry and song, and feasting as if at the end of a ten season famine! Brian Jacques crafted wonderful friends and heroes ate Redwall Abbey, and you’ll enjoy meeting them again and again!"

Never trust a vixen!",09/10/2013,"What another great read by Brian Jacques! A beautiful tale of battle, loss and redemption, and obstacles overcome during a quest to return what was stolen from Redwall Abbey. Woven into the new cast of characters are familiar faces from earlier redwall stories, and with the author's marvelous ability to weave in songs and poems throughout the tale. I always enjoy reading these tales, primarily because the writing becomes so visceral that I can picture scene after scene unfolding before me."

A Poor Edition",31/07/2013,"The book itself is a wonderful tale but I am going to do something here that I have chided others about doing; rate the quality of the edition rather than the writing.  I am so disappointed in the construction of this book, I know it has been out for some time, we bought it to replace a copy in the library that got destroyed, but honestly, I think the qality of the paper would have been better if we had ordered a paperback!  The paper in the book looks like newsprint, not like the stuff you normally find in a hardcover book. In addition to that, the book is too small and in no way compares to the original hardcopy edition."

Cassie Clare at her best",11/02/2018,"***Review posted on The Uncharted Word blog***By the Angel, this book is phenomenal! As I’ve said before, I rarely give books a perfect score, but this one and ACOMAF have come pretty damn close. There are so many great things I have to say about Lady Midnight, so let me begin by saying bravo, Ms. Clare. Bravo. I truly think Lady Midnight is your best one yet.WHAT I LOVEDThe story starts off in the Shadow Market, a place where Downworlders and mundanes with the Sight sell their wares, and we are briefly introduced to a mysterious character named Johnny Rook and his equally intriguing son, Kit. From there, we catch our first glimpse of our witty heroine, Emma Carstairs, who is accompanied by a fellow Shadowhunter. She is at the market to further her investigation into her parents’ suspicious murders. Rook has some useful secrets to sell, and these secrets reveal a bigger mystery at hand. *Cue the X-Files music.*Some weird stuff is going down that may or may not be related to the death of Emma’s parents and though the Clave would prevent her from continuing an investigation into these strange occurrences, nothing is going to stand in the way of Emma and her thirst for vengeance.The beginning is much more fast paced than most of her other novels in the Shadowhunter’s series. It took me a while to get into the first book in both the Infernal Devices and the Mortal Instruments, but I had no such issue with Lady Midnight. Once I started reading, it was very hard to stop.Clare does an excellent job in capturing my attention and maintaining it unto the very end. There was never a dull moment in this monstrously big book. I was far too invested in the relationships that were built up and torn down throughout the novel. While the mystery aspect is compelling, the focus of the story rests on the characters. The who-dunnit element of the plot is complimentary yet subordinate to the family dynamics and romantic pairings of the novel. There are periods in which the action subsides or is purely absent, but I was never bored during these periods because the focus shifts to the Blackthorn family, their slow exploration of the mysterious deaths, and of course, the romance.The characters are the highlight of this book. Julian is, by far, my favorite character, second only to his brothers, Mark and Ty. His character is sensitive, artistic, loving, secretive, and just plain good. His perception of love is among the most romantic and mature I’ve read so far in a young adult fantasy novel. He loves his family more than life itself and he acts as the Papa Bear to his brothers and sisters, believing them to be his children, his babies, that he must care for until they don’t need him anymore.The times where he contemplates the what ifs in life are among the most heartbreaking. He’s been forced into a situation where he must be the father, rather than the brother, to his siblings and he constantly reflects on the decisions he makes, hoping that when the time comes for his babies to leave, they won’t resent him in the end.The interactions between Emma and Julian are heartwarming and realistic as they trade witty remarks in their casual banter and slowly begin to realize their true feelings for one another. Their interactions are sweet and pure and everything you could wish for in a YA romance. And though I loved Jemma, and I ship it to the ends of the earth, I was more in love with Julian and his family.Each member of the Blackthorn family is a character all their own and completely lovable. Mark is the lost child, even though he is the eldest. Dru is the horror film junkie and resident sweetheart. Livvy is the spunky twin with warrior potential. Ty is the lovably different one and twin to Livvy. And Tavvy is the baby. I loved each and every one of them so much that I nearly got a heart attack during the events in the end.Clare did well to portray diversity in a cast of characters that differ in ethnicity, language, class, sexual orientation, living situation, mental health, and so much more. You can always count on Clare to give you an LGBTQ+ romance that steals your heart and tears it up over and over again. The author also touches on some more serious topics regarding mental health and learning disabilities and these issues are represented mostly in Ty and his Uncle Arthur. So there’s never a lack of great content in the novel.Another thing I greatly appreciated was the tie-in of my favorite poem, Annabel Lee. The way Clare brought the poem to life was creative and original and superbly done. Each of the chapter titles are lines from the poem, and at first I thought that was all there was to it, but the titles are reflective of the story, the mystery, as a whole.WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE AS MUCHI had only a couple issues with this book. The first being the representation of the female characters. While both Emma and Cristina are strong and capable females who don’t need no man, there isn’t much else I could say about them. While Julian, Mark, and Ty are given remarkable complexities to their characters, Emma can mostly be summed up as a warrioress with a chip on her shoulder who tries too hard to be witty and is way too ditzy in some cases, especially in the case of love.""His voice was rough; he looked as if he hadn’t slept. Emma wondered what could have kept him up. Research?""By this time, a brick could have deciphered Julian’s feelings. No one should be that clueless, especially not our fearless heroine. Besides her, seemingly, deliberate ignorance, Emma is solely focused on solving her parents’ murders and getting revenge. I enjoyed the times she interacts with the Blackthorns, and though she lives with them, she still seems apart from them due to her single-minded purpose. She’s a likable character, better than Clary IMO, but still not the heroine I wish Clare would write.As for Cristina, I didn’t much care for her storyline. She’s a great companion to Emma and seems like a nice person, but I didn’t trust her the whole book and I don’t think that was Clare’s intention. I know next to nothing about the girl and though she’s a friend, I can’t seem to care about what she does or does not do. She really is that uninteresting in my eyes.My last issue with this book: There’s not nearly enough Magnus Bane.But that’s it! Lady Midnight was close to perfection in its storyline, cast of characters, action, romance, diversity, and humor (so much of this that I chuckled more than a few times while reading). Plus, the few twists at the end hurt like a b****, but it was worth it."

Fantastic start to a new series in the Shadowhunter world",05/06/2017,"I do not discuss any plot points in my review, so you will not be spoiled.While the Dark Artifices may not be my favourite Shadowhunter series, I believe it is the most well written thus far. It is difficult to accurately judge, as this is only the first book in a trilogy but the more that Cassandra Clare writes – the better a writer she becomes. Her books have always been fantastic but Lady Midnight just felt like another step up. Cassie has clearly grown as a writer and storyteller over the years, which gives me so much hope for all her future Shadowhunter novels.While it is possible to come into the Shadowhunter Chronicles with Lady Midnight as your first book, I would not suggest it. The Mortal Instruments is fantastic for that, as we follow Clary a girl who discovers that there is more to the world than the mundane life she thought she knew. The world building in that first series really lays the groundwork for Cassie’s entire Shadow World. Even in the Infernal Devices, we mainly experience the Shadow World through the eyes of Tessa who has also not grown up with the knowledge of who she is. That is the first aspect that makes Lady Midnight so different from the previous two series – our two main characters Emma and Julian have grown up as Shadowhunters.I felt that there was less world-building overall for the Shadow World, but that’s not to say that the world building in this novel wasn’t fantastic as can be expected from Cassandra Clare. The politics of the Clave and the Downworld, the role of the Shadowhunter and the world that they live in have been brilliantly described over the course of the novels that Cassie has written. It is for this reason that I feel that while it is not necessary to read the Infernal Devices or the Mortal Instruments before reading the Dark Artifices, I would highly recommend it. You won’t necessarily understand the history or the events that led up to Lady Midnight as well as you could. There are also spoilers from the previous series and character cameos that you won’t appreciate as much unless you read the previous series.The world building the Los Angeles itself and the new aspects that Cassie writes about the Shadow World, like the Shadow Market, are absolutely fantastic in this book. With each book she writes in the Shadowhunter World, she continues to build and develop this immersive experience that is like no other. Her words are vividly descriptive and paint the image of the world in your mind. It is what makes her such an incredible writer and one of the reasons that I love her books so much.Lady Midnight takes place in Los Angeles, the Institute that has been the home of the Blackthorn children for their whole lives. Our main characters, Emma and Julian are parabatai which makes for a nice change to the point of view that we have experienced before. You learn a lot more about the parabatai bond and its potential in this book.With Helen exiled to Wrangel Island and Mark taken by the Hunt, Julian has had to raise his brothers and sisters for the last five years. This forced him to grow up a lot faster than he would have otherwise and changed him in various ways. He loves his family more than anything else in the world and would do anything for them, even if it meant crossing a line. That ruthless heart, willingness to betray, and capacity to lie was learned after the Dark War. Those were not traits that he had prior but were forced upon him when everything changed and the Clave tore his family apart.Emma has made it her life’s mission to discover who killed her parents at the end of the Dark War and why. That mystery has defined her every day, pushing her to train for hours at a time, run along the beach to get faster and turn her into an incredible Shadowhunter. She is also very sassy, quippy in conversations and the midst of a battle, which reminds me a lot of Jace.The other characters we spend time with throughout the book are Julian’s siblings: Ty, Livvy, Dru, and Tavvy; Cristina; Diana and Malcolm. Diana has a lot of secrets, which I’m sure we’ll discover over time, but she’s the character we end up knowing the least about. Beyond being their tutor, not wanting to take over the Institute and supposedly taking her travel year in Thailand, I can’t tell you anything about her.It was nice to see the Blackthorn children grow and develop from how we knew them in the Mortal Instruments to this series. Their familial relationship and interactions were authentic and heartwarming. You fall in love with them, just like you do with Cassie’s other characters and understand Julian’s plight.Cristina is a Shadowhunter from the Mexico City Institute who decided to spend her travel year in Los Angeles. It was nice to get to know her because we don’t always get to experience or hear from Shadowhunters from other Institutes. I really enjoyed her addition to the Blackthorn family (plus one) and the dimension she added.  Plus, her backstory created a connection to the Scholomance and the Centurions which are going to add even more world building to the Shadow World we know – and I can’t wait to see more of it.Malcolm is the High Warlock of Los Angeles and although his personality is very different, you immediately like him. He’s more playful and childlike at times than Magnus but seems to really care for the family. After falling in love with Magnus in the Mortal Instruments, and Catarina Loss to a lesser degree in Tales from the Shadowhunter Academy, I wanted Malcolm to be the next warlock character I loved.There is so much betrayal in this book that I could never anticipate what was going to happen next. It doesn’t just come from those you would consider “bad guys” but Shadowhunters, crooks and those with broken hearts alike. Cassandra Clare is the Queen of plot twists, fantastic character development and astounding, emotional rollercoasters in her books – and this was no exception.Lady Midnight was a fantastic read that made me fall in love with the Shadowhunter World all over again or more than I was before? It’s unclear. Either way, I adore this book and I actually think that I enjoyed it more the second time through. I would also highly recommend a re-read prior to Lord of Shadows because the novel is so packed full of incredible character development, world building and plot that you will appreciate its sequel more if the story is still fresh in your mind."

Amazing and Hard to put down...BUT",26/05/2016,"I have to say this was a great book! I loved it from the beginning to almost the end and then I became kind of disappointed. Let me explain. AND there is no way for me to explain without there being SPOILERS! So if you don't want to know anything please don't read this review.OK, now that has been said: I loved Emma and Julian. If you have read the Mortal Instruments you know these two. You know from the beginning Julian is in love with Emma. Emma takes a while to come to the conclusion that she loves Julian. I was a bit surprised at the love scenes in this book. It is not a romance novel and I thought those could have been left out. After all in the Mortal Instruments Cassandra hinted at them but did not go into detail. This was a surprise for me and one I thought was better left out.The runes gaining power from your Parabatai when you were in love with each other was actually very cool. The secrets being kept from Emma and Julian were not cool. And the fact that Emma, instead of telling Julian about the ""curse"" decides to latch onto Mark...well, I thought that was not the best option for her. And then there is Mark, who grows into his own in his family, fights beside them grows to love them and then what does he do...Cassandra has him lash out at Ty. That made absolutely no sense to me at all. It was out of character for the Mark she had developed thus far in the book. Another problem I had with what was done with Mark's character was at the very end. Emma asks him to essentially betray his brother Julian and he agrees without asking for any details. In fact he almost became evil in my eyes when he says ""Why Lie?"" That was NOT his character...faerie blood or no faerie blood. It was an awful turn for his character and one that made me loose much respect for him.Tavvy...he is seven years old but they constantly refer to him as the baby and her descriptions of him are those of a toddler..not a seven year old. He is treated like a toddler, carried like a toddler, and at one point have him sitting in a bag of sugar on the floor with it all over him. I am sorry, this is not the actions of a seven year old. Really all the children are somewhat portrayed as mush younger than they are.I simply did not like the ending of this book at all. And why not use Cortana, Emma's blade, to slice through their parabatai runes? Didn't her mother tell her Cortana could slice through anything? Ruin the rune and sever the parabatai tie between Emma and Julian. Or ask Jem and Tessa for help for crying out loud!Jem and Tessa: barely in the book. When they do show up they bring with them who they have been looking for over the last 5 years. They get him and bring him to the Institute, drop him off, and then vanish. What the heck!Then there is the short story at the end...if you have the hardback/paperback you will have read it. For those of us on e-readers...it was not included.  I stumbled upon it as I was looking on the internet for the release date of the second book. Which by the way is in March of 2017.Anyway, Cassandra takes us back to just before when Magnus, Clary, Jace, and Robert show up at the institute after Emma has killed you know who. She takes us to the New York Institute where Simon and Isabel have gotten engaged and Clary and Jace are off by themselves in a private room. What is with Clary's response? Again, it did not make any sense to me at all. And what was with everyone coming up to her and unloading on her? Maia is a strong leader..she can take care of her pack and so is Lily with her clan. So why did they feel it was necessary to go to Clary to have her stop the fight? It felt very immature and contrived.However, all that happened at the very end of the book. Up until the last chapter..I was completely enthralled and couldn't stop reading. It is still a 4 star but I just wish she had not done some of the things she had in the last chapter. I guess the last chapter felt very rushed to me. Like she could have had another chapter or two and then ended it. And now we wait...one whole year. Maybe she will take pity on us and release it early?"

& all that other good stuff lol",06/06/2016,"I AM BLOWN AWAY. SPEECHLESS. & all that other good stuff lol. My expectations were through the roof for this book as Cassie's previous series' the Mortal Instruments and the Infernal Devices are two of my favorite YA fantasy series' of all time still to this day. Let me just sat this book is a new favorite of mine and did not disappoint at all and was so worth the wait!! It was nearly impossible to review this book without spoilers because there is so much that I want to say about Lady Midnight! I watched and read some other book bloggers reviews and it was so interesting to hear different opinions and perspectives. Without further ado here's my two cents on Cassie's newest addition Lady Midnight.I will start off by saying that I am extremely disappointed in myself for reading this so early in the game. I mean honestly it just came out two seconds ago, and we all know the second installment won't be out anytime soon. Possibly another 1-2 years (which I understand why they take long to come out, if it was rushed the work won't be nearly as amazing). However it's too late to cry over the proverbial spilled milk. Anywho lets begin! Our story centers around Emma Carstairs trying to find who murdered her parents 5 years ago, as well as finding the person responsible for the many murders taking place in Los Angeles. I was very curious on how this mystery was going to start, and if you've read City of Heavenly Fire at the very end of the book you get a clue about how. Since it's been so long since I read COHF I honestly forgot about the little clue we got. However once the Shadowhunters of the Los Angeles Institute get help from some unlikely allies the race to solve the mystery of the multiple murders that are happening in LA. The theme of revenge is very much present in this novel and it definitely adds a tone of seriousness to the novel. We actually witnessed some of the aftermath of Emma's parents murder in COHF, and how much it affected Emma. I really appreciated being able to begin the novel without having to be retaught everything about the Shadowhunter world. Some authors will give a refresher in each novel, but more often than not this annoys me as I want to get to the meat of the story without preamble. Cassie smoothly transitioned into a new series with a fresh perspective and has managed to add more diverse and complexities to an already phenomenal world. She keeps you on your toes at all times and I can't wait to see what it will further develop into in the future. The characters in this novel were so well developed and felt so human to me, I really appreciated that we first met them when they were children and it's crazy cool to get to see how they've grown and developed in the 5 years since the Dark War happened. Emma, Julian, and the gang are much more mature than those of Clary, Jace & co. from the MI were so that alone is a big contributor to the tone of the novel. All the characters in this novel are so very well developed and I found myself completely smitten with them all very early in the book. There personalities are all so very different but they all manage to coexist as a family even with the tough past they all endured. I also must say that I loved loved seeing some of our favorite characters from the previous series like Clary, Jace, Magnus, & Tessa! I have my fingers crossed that we will see even more of them in this series as it progresses. Last thing I will touch on so that I don't accidentally slide into spoilers territory is the Emma and Julian romance. My goodness is it a roller coaster ride, their situation very much reminds me of Clary & Jace when they believed they were brother and sister early on in the Mortal Instruments. The forbidden romance element is there as they are parabatai, so expect to be shouting at your book, and there even may be a couple of tears ( that's if you're uber-sensitive like myself haha). When we learned the reason why parabtai are forbidden to fall in love I nearly fell out of my chair! It's so very hard to review complex books like these without spoilers because they literally are everywhere! I am contemplating the idea of doing a video review with spoilers because there are endless things I can say and would like to hear you guys' perspectives and opinions too! Cassie has flawlessly laid the groundwork for the remaining to novels in the series and I am already chomping at the bit for the release of the next book. I will be back tomorrow with a review of an audibook that I am just about finished up with. As always, until next time!Check out my blog for more fun reviews at obsessivecompulsivereads.com"

In a Kingdom By the Sea........",14/04/2016,"I do recommend to get the most out of Lady Midnight that you read The Mortal Instruments series and The Infernal Devices series first as many of the characters from each show up or are talked about in Lady Midnight. THERE IS ONE OR TWO MINOR SPOILERS FROM BOTH SERIES IN THIS REVIEW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I would also like to say I am very sorry that this review isn't as in depth and thought out as some of my others as I did this by memory and I usually have around 4 pages of notes.Julian Blackthorn and Emma Carstairs have been best friends as long as they can remember and after the Dark War where Emma lost her parents and Julian his father,sister,and brother,they have been each others only support system. They become parabatai which are partners in battle and best friends who promise to stay by each other side forever. But being a parabatai also means you can't fall in love with each other. It is forbidden and the punishment is harsh. Emma has never thought that her parents where killed in the Dark War but by someone else and has been looking for the killer and clues that she is right for years. When more and more people and faeries are killed, the faeries come to Julian and Emma and offer a deal. If they find the killer they can have back Julian's brother Mark who they took in the Dark War. Love, Loyalty, and Family all collide in the first book of the Dark Artifices series.I finished Lady Midnight last night after reading 200 plus pages in one sitting. I fell in love with Julian, Emma, Christina, Mark, and the rest of the characters. Clare's characters crawl under you skin and plant themselves in your heart. I loved how both Julian and Emma were both so different from Clare's other heroes and heroines.  Emma is reckless, an amazing warrior, loves with everything she has and wants to hurt anyone who even looks at the people she loves sideways, and has a great wit. Julian is nothing like Clare's other heroes. He had to at a young age take on the raising of 4 siblings. He will do anything to save the people he loves no matter what the cost. He is more ruthless then you would think reading about him because he seems very gentle and he is with the people he loves but don't let that fool you into thinking he wouldn't gut anyone who is a danger to people he loves. I think he is the perfect counterpart to Emma and I Ship these two. I love Mark, Julian's half faerie brother and I have since I meet him in City of Heavenly Fire(The Mortal Instruments Book 6). He is so messed up from being in faerie and seeing him rejoin the human race is just as funny as it is heartbreaking. Christina was a really interesting character as she is running from something in her past(she is from Mexico City) and it was a surprise when I found out why had run away to the LA. Christina and Emma became good friends very fast and it is nice that unlike Clare's other heroines,Emma does have a girl friend to talk too. You also fall in love with all Juilan's siblings from the twins Livia(who loves the saber as a weapon) and Tiberius(who wants to be a detective),to Drusilla(who love all things horror),and the youngest Octavian(who really wants to help his older siblings in the investigation and help keep his older brother home). Malcolm the High Warlock of L.A. was a character that I was very interested in having meet him in City of Heavenly Fire and you find out what happened to him to make him so absent minded and unique in Lady Midnight. There is huge cast of characters and you just love them all.The plot was just amazing with so much action, twists, turns, twists again, love forbidden, love lost, love forgotten, loyalty tested, trust broken, family lost, family found, choices made that can never be undone,heartbreak, hearts healed, lies told and retold, magic, more magic,and finally that heartbreaking ending that will leave you yelling NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! You can't end it there! Lady Midnight had everything I look for it a book.It has great writing, a plot with twists and turns, characters that you fall in love with and don't leave you, and a world you want to be part of.  If you want a book you can't put down, characters you miss the second you turn the last page,and writing that hits the ball out of the park then this is the book for you.Rating: 5 out of 5Content:PG-13"

One of her best!",01/04/2016,"Anything and everything Shadowhunters- that's the policy I live by.  It's one of my go-to series of books for a number of reasons, mostly because I grew up reading them (City of Bones was one of the first YA books I ever picked up) and they have managed to continuously entertain me, no matter how many times I reread them.  The older I get, the harder it is to enjoy some books I read years ago.  Shadowhunter books, too, are beautifully written and always make me and my heart cry, so, even though that may not sound like it, it's always a pleasure to pick one up.Lady Midnight takes place several years after the events in the Mortal Instrument's series.  It follows Emma Carstairs, her parabatai Julian Blackthorn, his family, and her new friend Cristina Rosales, as they illegally investigate some faerie murders that are taking place.I was worried about picking this one up.  I had such high hopes, but it's been two years since a new Shadowhunter book, so I had no idea whether it would be any good, if the story would still hold up, if I could still connect to the characters in such a manner as I had before.  If the story would be good at all, or if the amount of characters would end up hurting it more than helping.  Well, I shouldn't have been worried- it was amazing.  And I'm not just saying that because I'm a super fan, I'm saying that because, were this the only book by her that I had read, I would have loved it as much as I do now.For one, the characters.  Like I said, I was worried the sheer number might throw the book off course.  No problem here.  Clare managed to balance them all out nicely, made each unique and important to the story, and also got me to care about every single one of them.  Once in a while there would be blink-and-you-miss-it scenes where a character would be dismissed and I would lose track of them and have to turn back a page and see what happened, but even while I lost track on these rare occasions, Clare didn't, and she managed to juggle them all nicely.  My favorite character had to be Mark (for many reasons, many of them spoilery).  He's a great character, and one we haven't really seen before, at least in her writing.  Closely following him in list of favorites is Emma, our heroine, and a capable one at that.  She's very different from Clary and Tessa, and I love her for it.  It's hard to pin her down with just a few word description, but she falls on the list of characters who are kick-ass first, take names later.  Were I to mention and describe every character here that would be a long review- but leave it at, I loved them all.  There wasn't any character that I found myself disliking for any reason (unless they're, you know, the villain, in which case I'm not supposed to like them).The story itself was very good and rather interesting, though I found the ending to be not what I expected.  I mean, yes, there are some wicked (and awesome) twists that caught me off guard and had me half-grinning, half-completely in shock, but the way the novel is concluded was not what I would expect.  I can't say much more here because Spoilers and what-not, but don't let me make you think it was a bad ending.  Just a surprising way to wrap things up as they were.  I liked it a lot more upon reflection, though at the time it felt out of the ordinary and strange.One little theory I have before I close this review, and it's not a spoilery theory, I promise: I have guesses for who might be on the next two covers.  I think, and I'm not sure the order, that it will be Mark and Julian.  They're both major characters and seem the most likely, due to the plot of the series (so far).So, yes, I strongly recommend picking this one up.  You can read it without reading the other Shadowhunter books- it won't be confusing, you just won't get certain things out of it.  And if you're a fan of Shadowhunters in general, then, yes, this is a must-read for you.  You won't be let down.  It's completely unnerving to see the names Jem, Tessa, Clary, and Jace all appear on one page, but it's worth it."

Beautiful and Heartbreaking Continuation of a Franchise",22/03/2016,"Love love love. I'll admit straight out that I'm a fan of series and franchises in general; I love seeing bits and pieces of information about characters from related series and learning more about an already-developed world. But for anyone who's worried that the Dark Artifices is just a a dragging-on of the Mortal Instruments because we all refuse to let go of our Shadowhunters, you will not regret picking up this book.I'm so happy with the dynamic of the character relationships in this book. While the focus in both the Mortal Instruments and the Infernal Devices is a main character who is initially unfamiliar with the Shadow World becoming part of both that world and the friend/family group of the respective Institutes, Lady Midnight begins this new series with a group of characters that is much younger overall, more tightly bonded, and more thoroughly involved with the world of Shadowhunters. This is not a story, like the others, about finding a new world and forging new relationships; it's about the strain that events put on the existing relationships between most of the characters.Presenting an established family group in this way cuts out the period of adjustment and building of bonds that we get in the other series, and watching those relationships strained and strengthened makes the story sometimes heartbreaking and often bittersweet and very touching. I think Julian may be my favorite Shadowhunter across all the books so far; he is a heart-wrenching mass of contradictions--gentle artistry and fierce fighting, strict restraint and overflowing love, responsibility and humorous love of fun, absolute dedication to family and a wall of lies separating him from his loved ones--and I can't wait to see where he ends up in the rest of the series because the life he's been living in the years leading up to this book is simply not tenable.Though Julian is the most striking character to me, one of my favorite things about this book is that you can't really pinpoint who the ""main"" character is. Without giving any spoilers, I can say that Julian and Emma are quite equally represented in terms of point of view and what I can only think to call ""screen time,"" and there are at least three other characters from whose point of view we see the story from very early on in the book and consistently throughout.My friend and I (she just finished the book today, while I finished it two days ago, and our texting while reading has been a little crazy) were discussing today how impressed we are with Clare's world building. She continues in this book to do a great job representing the validity of many different kinds of relationships and lifestyles while also acknowledging the difficulty of being different in a culture that is far from progressive. She has built a consistent culture around the harsh and often arrogant Shadowhunters, and she makes it clash wonderfully with the modern world, both in their rejections of Mundane culture (like using new technology) and in their archaic attitudes towards disorders like autism (and mentioned more tangentially, ADHD and depression). Not only do these issues create depth in the world of the books, they also work into the plot in many ways.The plot, or maybe I should say the ""action plot""--the fight against the current evil--is my least favorite thing in the book, which might sound like it deserves more than a passing mention at the end of the review, but it's certainly not a bad plot, and the emotional development of the book is way more compelling. I think the plot of this book will lead into even more interesting action in the following two books, and I look forward to seeing how that will intertwine with the character development.And one last thing: the romance. It will keep you entertained throughout. It's all ""no no no...say how you feel!...no no...yes!...no, don't interrupt...yes, finally!...no no...yessss...no nooo NO NOOOO...what's happening?"" Get what I mean? No? Well, you'll get it once you read the book. It's a roller coaster. It's wonderful and sad and exciting, and I'm sure it's only going to get more intense in the next book."

An okay addition to the Shadowhunter series",28/03/2016,"Ok, I'm not gonna lie.  I was almost done with Cassandra Clare after she had written another 3 books after the TMI trilogy should have been over.  I absolutely loved the first 3 books, and was pretty disappointed when it seemed to continue.  I was even hesitant about TID trilogy as it seemed Cassandra Clare cannot break from some character tropes and the plot was pretty similar to TMI.So with this in mind, I had almost written her off and wasn't interested in buying her next book....That is, until I read the book flap at the local bookstore.Dang it, Cassandra, why did you do this to me?Beware of some SPOILERS!!!!  So it does seem that Cassandra still falls into her own formulaic trap of having a ""forbidden love"" because of the law that parabatai cannot fall in eros (romantic love) with each other.  That is going to be one of the mysteries of the story.  So Emma (remember the girl from the last books in the TMI sextet?) is 17 now and a badass Shadowhunter herself, and the reason she is that way is she has been on a mission for the past 5 years to enact her revenge on the person (or persons) who murdered her parents in the Dark War.  With her parabatai, Julian a.k.a. ""Jules"", she feels she can accomplish anything.  When Emma gets a lead about some murders that are taking place in her hometown of Los Angeles, some leads that are very similar to how her parents were murdered, it sets off a chain of events that could possibly ruin the Los Angeles Institute.Here is what I liked:  Cassandra has a pretty good handle on making a lot of characters for a book but making each on distinct from the other.  This will also tie in to something I don't like, but we'll get in to that later.  She makes these characters that any lesser author would write and then forget about or put them in awkwardly in scenes.  The interactions here amongst her characters seem organic.  It is a fairly quick read--I was able to chomp through about 3/4 of the book in a couple of hours--so don't let the length deter you.  Emma is a pretty likeable and believable character.  She is rather complex as she loves the Blackthorn family who has taken her in, but her subconscious actions can be perceived as self-destructive as most of her driving force is directed towards revenge.  Cassandra does a really great job of handling an autistic character in the book.  Since Shadowhunters do not have the same medical vocabulary as mundanes, there is no word or diagnosis for autistic people.  This character is portrayed in a pretty realistic and poetic sense.  I really like the Faerie culture she is creating for us, from the language to history to the actions of some of the Faerie characters she put in this book.Here is what I didn't like:  Cassandra seems to have a formula that she just can't shake.  So while I mentioned earlier that all her characters seems distinct in the books, as a whole (looking at the books she has written so far) she seems to have some tropes that she plugs in to her books and just gives them a different name.  If you've read the first of TMI, then you can guess what will happen in this book (which I did) and so you can see what is coming before it happens.  So when the big reveal finally happens, you are not really shocked.  Or you shouldn't be, if you've been paying attention.It is fairly hard when you've written so much about 1 world as Cassandra has to keep things fresh.  This is a pretty decent addition to her Shadowhunter series, but I would like to see her take some risks in her writing soon (break from her formula), or write something that doesn't take place in this world."

LADY MIDNIGHT BOOK REVIEW",19/07/2016,"There are books you buy quickly, but there are books you have to wait like 2 freaking years to finally have them. Lady Midnight is the first book of a new trilogy called The Dark Artifices. It is set in the Shadowhunter world, featuring the life of Emma Carstairs and the Blackthorn family.First of all, I missed the Shadowhunter world so much and now my heart aches because I finished this book and I have to wait a whole year to get the second one. I really liked the setting of this book. It is set in Los Angeles, and they are right by the beach which is cool and I envy them. Cassandra Clare is an expert writing about forbidden love, and I love her for that. Every single love story she writes, is full of love, magic, mysteriousness, passion, and sadness.The Blackthorn family is so united. A really young boy had to take care of his whole brothers and sisters, and if you haven’t realized, that happens a lot in our real world. I really enjoyed how they support each other and how they looked out for each other now that they’re bigger. Every single member of this family is different and unique, and you can see the diversity in their interests. On the other hand, we have the amazing Emma Carstairs, which by the way reminds me of Jace Herondale. Emma is a strong woman, I feel proud of her you know, she dealt with the loss of her parents and she couldn’t stop grieving but she trained every day, and she is becoming one of the best shadowhunters in the world. Cristina is a latina and she is amazing. I appreciate and enjoy having diversity in books.You all know the plot of this book; forbidden love and betrayal. You also know who are the ones that are in love. Guess what? I SHIP THEM. THEY ARE OTP. I NEED THEM TOGETHER. I really, reaaaaaally think they are so freaking cute, and they are right for each other. Stupid law and curse that prevent them of being together. Because of the law and their families they have to put their love and their happiness away, because if they don’t do that, there are going to be a few problems. Also, we have the other part of the plot; betrayal. The Blackthorn family had a good friend that was creating murderers in order to bring his true love back to life. When I realized who he was, I was shocked and I screamed for like an entire hour. I almost forgot, THE LOST HERONDALE IS NO LONGER LOST AND IM SO EXCITED GUYS.Overall, I think Cassie did an amazing job writing this book. It was so freaking good and it didn’t have a boring chapter. It was an action-packed, fast paced story. I liked how this story talked about mental illness, and about family. It is really good that Cassie wrote about mental illness in this amazing world. Julian is one of the most mature man I’ve ever read about and I just need to love him a little bit more every day. The ending left me thinking about City of Ashes. I think that what we’re going to read in the next book about two characters will be something like Clary and Simon in City of Ashes. I don’t even know why I think that, but I do so don’t judge me. Also, every name of each chapter was taken from the poem Annabel Lee by Edgar Allan Poe, and now I just want to read it. I recommend this book to everyone, of course. Everyone should read every shadowhunter book because this world is absolutely brilliant, beautiful and badass. You won’t regret it. Stop being a mundane, and welcome to the Shadowhunter world."

When's the next book due out?!?",11/03/2016,"Lady Midnight by Cassandra Clare is the first in The Dark Artifices, a new Shadowhunters series set around the Shadowhunters Institute in LA.  It focusses on Emma Carstairs and her parabatai Julian Blackthorn, characters introduced in City of Heavenly Fire, the final book in the Mortal Instruments series.  This was one of my most anticipated reads of 2016 and I LOVED it.  The setup for Lady Midnight was one of the things I enjoyed most about City of Heavenly Fire and it more than lived up to its promise.What I likedThe characters.  Although Emma is a smart, engaging kickass heroine, I found my sympathies being drawn more to Julian - his struggles and challenges spoke to me even more than Emma’s.  I was also very interested that this time we meet some Shadowhunters who do not necessarily fit the mould of young teens, perfect in mind and body who embody the ideals of the Clave.  Particularly interesting to me was Tiberius, who is clearly on the autism spectrum.  I thought it was wonderful how he was shown to make a significant contribution to our protagonists’ quest even if it wasn’t always by going out and fighting demons.  I am interested to see how the Clave tries to handle him in the future.  We also have Mark Blackthorn, who, although technically a Shadowhunter has been strongly influenced by his time with the Fae.  In both these cases we clearly see how Shadowhunter society in general is not very accepting of those who do not fit a specific mould.The Law.  The Law is a major theme in this book, specifically how to handle a law that seems harsh or unfair.  This is symbolised by two Latin phrases “Sed lex, dura lex” - the Law is hard, but it is the Law - and “lex malla, lex nulla” - a bad law is no law at all.  This refers mainly to the law against helping the Fair Folk, and this is used to hinder our protagonists in their quest.  We see attempts to get around this law both by diplomatic means and then by less open methods.  Of course this theme also applies to the law against parabatai falling in love, which is also a major issue for our protagonists.  All in all, it didn’t leave me feeling very positive towards the Clave and Council.  I look forward to seeing how Julian and Emma and their friends change their world for the better.The world.  I really don’t need to say much here.  Clare’s world is absolutely phenomenal and fascinating.  What was particularly interesting this time was seeing a post Dark War world.  The struggle with Sebastian has left its mark and even five years later, the results can still be seen.  We learn of new, elite Shadowhunters and processes that have been put in place as a result of the War - processes that aren’t necessarily for the best.  I’m not sure if Clare was aiming to reflect our modern post 9/11 world in this, but that is certainly what it made me think of.What I didn’t likeBland, boring antagonist.  I wasn’t especially engaged by the antagonist - however, I suspect that the real villain of the piece was intended to be the rigid, inflexible attitude of those in charge of the Shadowhunters and the climate of fear that seems pervasive.  I would imagine we’ll see our heroes come into direct conflict with that later on in the series.I gave Lady Midnight five stars out of five - when is the next book due out?"

Interesting story that expands on the universe that we know and love",15/03/2016,"I've been waiting for what seemed like FOREVER for this book.  I couldn't quite devour it as quickly as other readers (boring adult responsibilities and all that... Julian would understand), but I finished it as quickly as I could.I loved this book.  I understand how some people might be annoyed that Clare is still writing about Shadowhunters, but I don't care.  I love the world that she has created, and I love reading more about the characters and learning more about why things are the way they are in that world.  I, am thrilled that Clare has continued to write about this world and different parts about it.Lady Midnight expands upon the world that Clare has introduced us to in TMI & TID (The Mortal Instruments & The Infernal Devices). We follow a whole new generation of Shadowhunters and the problems that they face.The Shadowhunters of the L.A. Institute are a unique bunch.  The characters are wonderfully drawn in words.  To be perfectly honest, I was somewhat annoyed by the sheer number of the Blackthorns that I had to remember and keep up with at first, but after several chapters and much thought, I could see why there needed to be so many of them.  Each one has their own distinct personality and bring their unique qualities to the table. The character development was really good, in my opinion.  I feel like it was especially good for Julian, who grew up quickly taking care of his family and having so much responsibility.One other thing that slightly annoyed be about the book were the paragraphs that quickly summarized backstory (like who the Silent Brothers were, what parabatai were, etc). They felt like sidebars in a story that slowed down the plot.  I understand that they were put there so that anyone could read and understand Lady Midnight (without having to read the previous Shadowhunter books), but since I was a veteran Shadowhunter reader, I was impatient and wanted to hurry up and skip over it so that continue with the story.  I feel like most of those ""sidebar"" paragraphs were probably in the first 100 pages or so.  I don't remember much of them beyond that.But on to the things that I liked about this book:I liked that we learned more about the laws of the Clave and why they did certain things. We also learn more about the history of some of the most ""famous"" Shadowhunter families, and even get a few surprises.  It wasn't just another Shadowhunter story.. I feel like it had purpose because it answered some questions I had about their world that we previously hadn't been answered.I also liked the few cameos that appeared: Jem, Tessa, CHURCH!.  Jace, Clary, and Magnus also made a brief appearance.  I liked that they didn't take the focus off of Julian and Emma and the rest of the Blackthorn family.I liked that so many characters surprised me.Overall, it was a great read.  I can't wait to read Lord of Shadows (can it hurry up and be released?! Please?)  I am a little bummed that they are going to release Book 1 of the Last Hours before they release Lord of Shadows.  I'm emotionally invested in this story and need to know what happens next ASAP :)"

I pulled an all nighter...",08/03/2016,"My intention had been to download the Kindle version, read for about half an hour and go to bed.  Here I am hours later, in the early morning, having finished the book.  It really is a wonderful read and does not disappoint.  There are a limited number of things that I can say because the book reads like a mystery novel and there are certain surprises that are important to keep so as not to ruin it for others.It has been a bit since I’ve read any of the Shadowhunter books and have not read the mortal instruments.  However, I found that the book was easy to follow without this background, although I need to read the Mortal Instruments at some point to have a better introduction to Jem and Tessa.  It’s nice though, there are multiple characters that overlap from the other books, but this is not a story about them, there is a recognition of the past history of the world that occurs in the other books and then “Lady Midnight” gives a nod to them and establishes its own story with its own characters.There was a bit of time in which I thought that the narrative was going to be very similar to that of Jace and Clary and Simon, but I then recognized that the characters of Emma and Julian, Mark, Cristina, and Diego are distinct; it’s almost enjoyable to encounter these characters as the same age as Jace and Clary, who in turn now look at the younger generation from their own adulthood of early twenties.  It’s a reminder of how far the series has come and developed the characters.There is a stronger relationship with the Faire in this book and it is insightful to see how this society/community establishes rules and responsibilities.  It further expands the world of characters Clare has introduced the reader to over the years.  The concept of parabatai is explored at length in this novel, with Julian and Emma introduced as parabatai who have been bonded since a young age as one another’s sworn friends, both having a mutual respect for on another in their Shadowhunting; it is compared to soul mates, who are then bonded by the Silent Brothers.  This is a concept introduced very early, so I’m not really disclosing anything that is secret in the story.Above all things this is a love story, a love story by so many people; some that are obvious and some that are not.  Almost every layer of this book has love at its heart and the sacrifices that people are willing to make for one another.  At the same time, it is also a mystery, with twists and turns, as the Los Angeles Institute is seeking to find a murder who is killing both humans and Fairies alike.Oh, one nice addition to this story, as Clare has seldom shy’d away from new characters, whether it is sexual orientation, or overall likeability, is the introduction of Ty, who appears to be autistic.  There is no mention of autism, but Ty’s relationship with his family, and inability to read human emotion to a certain extent, highlights his differences from others that he encounters.  I think that it was nice to have a character that Clare incorporates into the story, but is not signaled out as being autistic, but has variations in communication, or as seen through the eyes of family members who love a younger brother.Overall, a great read that kept me captivated all night!"

Five stars! Perfection! My favourite after The Mortal Instruments!",15/06/2017,"---I recommend reading Lady Midnight after The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices---YA Urban Fantasy13+""He sounded casual, calm, as if nothing had happened.  But everything had happened.""I've read Lady Midnight twice. Once last year as a new release and now again at the release of its second installment to refresh my memory before I dive into Lord of Shadows.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Lady Midnight again. Honestly it felt as if I were reading it for the first time. And I usually struggle with rereads. But Cassandra Clare is my favourite author.I love my Shadowhunters. And I love how the stories keep going from the epic beginning with The Mortal Instruments, to the movie City of Bones (which I am obsessed with---shame they were cancelled!!), to the lovely Victorian England setting of The Infernal Devices (Jem my precious love!!), to the tv adaptation (which I finally just shut up & accepted and learned to enjoy the fandom) and then to the beauty of The Dark Artifices.After TMI, Lady Midnight is my favourite. The characters were positively exceptional here (as all Clare's character are). Relatable, diverse, layered and entertaining. I've fallen in love with them all.I adore how the plot seems to have been built upon one of my absolute favourite poems by my favourite poet, Edgar Allan Poe! And reading all the little excerpts and quotes and chapter titles from Poe's ""Annabel Lee"" spoke to my soul. How brilliant! Like you don't even know how that calls to me.Lady Midnight gave me everything I seek in a book. Especially in this genre, which is where my obsession lies (ya Fantasy/Urban Fantasy). I need a bit of dark magic, a creepy villain (most times a hot one *ahem* Sebastian, because I'm twisted like that), some smut, a bit of romance, and even better--a lot of romance, betrayal, emotionally messed up boys, love triangles, more smut, some foul language, faeries, forbidden love, controversial issues *ahem again* Sebastian and Clary interactions, & teen drama all wrapped up in a lovely fantasy plot.**NOT saying ALL of those things are found in Lady Midnight! Nope, no spoiling here. But enough to where I'm satisfied. That's why Cassandra Clare is my favourite author. Because she satisfies my bookish hunger and always gives me what I want.Don't be frightened by the size of this book!! But honestly if you're a die hard fantasy fan, giant books don't scare you but excite you.Although, I must admit, that I have sustained a bookish injury whilst reading this beast---my wrists are bloody hurting, mate!  I've been reading it everyday for about two weeks. And it's heavy.I must gloat now. I brought Lady Midnight on summer holiday to the beach with me!! And guess what?? I read the infamous Chapter 18 whilst on the beach, sitting in the sand, with the crashing waves at my feet and the salty ocean air caressing my skin and the sun glittering off the deep blue waters.....*blissful sigh*I was *there*. I was with Julian and Emma. I *was* Emma.Reading Lady Midnight on the beach, in the same setting as in the book gave me life right there. It was everything.This book was everything to me. And that ending has had its hooks in me for an entire year!!"

An amalgamation of everything Clare does best",27/06/2016,"Cassandra Clare’s Lady Midnight takes place five years after the war that submerged the Shadowhunter world into darkness. Sebastian Morgenstern came, and he went, leaving behind a twisted legacy that doesn’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon. His actions affected Downworlders (supernatural creatures like fae and vampires) and Shadowhunters (those who protect against aforementioned supernatural creatures) alike. Today, a string of murders has popped up- there are no distinct patterns among the victims except that they are fae, and that Emma’s parents were murdered in eerily similar ways five years previously. With the help of her parabatai Julian, his family and a secret alliance between the Blackthorn Shadowhunters and the faeries, Emma must discover the truth behind her parents’ deaths and catch the murderer, all while dealing with the everyday pains of being a teenager.Lady Midnight is a triumph. It is Clare’s most intriguing, engrossing, captivating story since it finds the perfect balance between action, mystery and drama. This novel brings together the best elements of The Infernal Devices and The Mortal Instruments- the former’s empathetic characterization and relationships, and the latter’s contemporary snark and humor. It is modern and exciting while maintaining the sentimentality of the characters’ relationships with each other.The characters each serve a purpose within the larger storyline, and they’re all wonderfully constructed and their development becomes apparent as the story progresses. Clare has gotten out of the ‘damsel in distress’ protagonist trope, and has given us Emma who is courageous, independent and worthy. She has also gotten out of the ‘hot-headed bad boy’ trope for the love interests, and has presented Julian- a soft-spoken young man who likes art and romance. She gave him the burdens of being a father-figure to a group of young children all while being a teenager himself, and this did wonders for his characterization. I enjoyed all the secondary characters too; I hadn’t expected to get invested in this set of people, but I did.One of my only problems with this novel was the Big Bad, as you may call it. In her previous series, the main problem is one that has extremely high stakes, where the mortal world teeters on the edge of sanity and peril; in this one, I did not feel that the stakes were high enough. Which is not to say that it doesn’t have potential, because it does. I do feel that things are going to get much darker, much more sinister in the upcoming installments. And one final note, I also thought some of the cross-overs were forced. I would have much rather that Clare left her old characters behind instead of trying to force them to make an appearance in the book; it was pleasant to see them show up, but they did very little in the advancement of the plot. Perhaps in the next books we’ll see a more seamless crossing over than we did in this one.Over all, Clare has upped her game.

Love the shadowhunter world!",15/07/2018,"I have been a huge fan of the Shadowhunter world for years now, so I really don’t know why I didn’t pick this one up immediately. I think I fell behind with the novellas and then didn’t want to read anything out of order. But whatever the reason, I am so glad I finally read this one. It was better than I could have ever hoped.I absolutely loved the cast of characters. They all wormed their way into my heart very quickly. Emma is such a wonderful heroine. She is strong and feisty and sarcastic and a kickass Shadowhunter. Julian absolutely broke me. He gives so much and does so much for others and he deserves the world. He and Emma know one another inside and out and their chemistry is insane. Nobody does angst like Cassandra Clare. Cristina is also fantastic and such a good friend. And oh man how I loved the Blackthorns. Ty stole my heart. And Livvy and Dru are wonderful too. And then Tavvy is just adorable. And I’ve loved Mark for a while now and his story and history breaks me. I love this family and love how strong their bonds are.Nobody keeps me engaged like Cassandra Clare. It was such a good story and it kept me guessing. There were so many twists along the way and I was caught off guard so many times. I loved the heavier fae aspect. Clare’s fae are so beautiful and so deadly. They may not be able to lie, but they can manipulate and play the game so well. And I am just so intrigued by them. There was one fae who I kinda loved but also hated a bit and GAHHH so many complicated emotions. And that twist at the end. BANANAS.And I said I’ve been a fan of this world for a while and I absolutely loved going back. I love this world of Shadowhunters and Downworlders and I love learning more and more about it. I also loved checking in with some of my favorite characters again. I pretty much lost it when I got to see Jem and Tessa. And Jace and Clary and Magnus and a bunch of others. I love how Clare is really expanding on the Clave now and showing it has its flaws and can be exceptionally cruel. That is definitely going to be an interesting thread to explore.Lady Midnight was a fantastic book and it had a killer ending. The book delivered the angst and nobody does angst like Clare. My heart has been ripped to shreds and I can’t wait to read more."

half snooze that is immediately redeemed and turns into a huge pile of WHAT THE F IS GOING ON AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT?",04/04/2016,"Man Oh Man was I disappointed and shell shocked. I was absolutely stunned by my lack of interest in this book and especially these characters. I love love LOVED all of Cassandra Clare's books I have read thus far. Infernal Devises was absolute perfection and will forever have a place in my heart for introducing me (and the rest of the world...but he's mine :-) to Will Herondale who happens to be sooooo yummily swoon worthy it hurts (in a good way). The Mortal Instruments started the whole love train and I just couldn't get enough. I won't fangirl squee over all of Ms. Clare's amazing literary gifts. I wanted to love LM. I even counted the days until it was released. I admit it, I believed that this woman could do no wrong. Well....For starters, the first 60% of the book felt like a big snooze fest that had me wondering if Ms. Clare ran out of Awesome Juice and resorted to milking the Shadowhunter thing until it keeled over and begged to die. It took me 4 days to get halfway through and that, in my most humble of opinions is 3 days too long. I either fell asleep (this happened many, MANY times) or put the book down out of sheer boredom... a once unthinkable crime with regards to her master manipulations of my every emotion.NOW, this might seem like a crazy ranting ball of negativity... BUUUT I did say it took a little more than halfway through the book for me to start caring one whit about the LA Shadowhunters and their ilk. After that extra long intro it clicked! I cared, HARDCORE! The mystery of who's doing what to whom and who is in forbidden love and who is really loyal to which side and on and on it went until I found myself ugly crying...big fat, hungry infant style wailing, ugly tears. I cried in line waiting to pick up my little one from kindergarten with all the teachers and parents checking in on me periodically to make sure I was stable enough to drive away with a child on board...silent (or trying my hardest to be) ugly tears at 4:00am with the hubby huffing every time I woke him with a shudder.Is this book awesome? Yes! Does it leave you guessing until the end? Yes! Is it as good as Infernal Devices and the yummiest of yummm Will Herondale?? No :-( but after the sleepy bit it is definitely on par with her other works and worth the time and emotional rollercoaster damage but ask yourself-  could you honestly ask for anything more for your time, money and fangirl/boy devotion? NO! and that's why you should read this book...really...give it a go you won't be disappointed!"

Looking forward to the next book!!!",18/03/2016,"Overall it was a very good read. It was the kind of book that I got annoyed every time I had to put it down to go to work. I enjoyed TMI and TID series for the fantasy aspect, but I felt characterization with some of the main characters was poor or missing. I think a lot of that was improved with TDA. I really like Emma, Julian, Cristina, and Mark. They all have a lot of quirks and qualities that make them seem like real people. I think some of the younger Blackthorns are hard to keep track of, and I don't know them at all, but I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing or just a result of having such a large Blackthorn family. I was a bit bored at first with all the exposition at the beginning, so I skipped over most of it. Other than that the plot picked up in the middle and was very, very good. The bad guys aren't just bad guys, they have a reason for what they do, which makes them more believable. The twist(s) at the end were well done, although I had guessed one of them already, but maybe only because I had been searching for it. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because although Cassandra Clare does an amazing job of setting up this fantasy world that I'd love to live in, there was way too much Clary and Jace. I think Cassandra Clare did this because so many people love them and wanted to see them, but I think the hero worship of Clary and Jace feels very unrealistic and forced five years later. Why does the shadowhunter world still revolve around Clary and Jace and their accomplishments and their famous love story? I think Cassandra Clare might be attached to these characters and wants to keep writing about them and how well they are doing, but I think it takes away from the new characters. And these new characters have much more character and spunk. Other than the fact that she has red curly hair and green eyes and is particularly small, I would not be able to identify Clary based on personality or behavior despite reading all of the TMI books. Emma, on the other hand, I could pick out of a crowd without a description of appearance. I know that maybe this sounds very critical, but keep in mind if you are reading this review that I really love Cassandra Clare's writing and have read and enjoyed pretty much everything she has written. I am looking forward to the next book!!!"

Not as good as TMI or TID, but worth a read.",15/05/2016,"I adore Cassandra Clare's TMI and Infernal Devices series, with the latter being my preferred story, but Jace and Clary being two of my favorite characters of all time. However, I found this story hard to capture me. There is enough intrigue in figuring out who is behind the murders and what happened to Emma's parents, but I found that there were too many Blackthorn children that slimming them down would have helped me to care about them a bit more.Breaking it down, Emma and Julian are enriching characters and I liked them despite the writing that would sometimes, I feel, drag the story down with repetitiveness. After awhile, it was clearly understood how attracted they were to each other, so the insertion of them noticing the other one's body and describing it in the middle of a scene in which something else was happening slowed it down too much for my taste. I think we all understand pretty early on in the series how these two feel about each other, and after awhile I felt as though I was reading the same thing, just worded differently, which always seems a little insulting. I get it. I know that's happening in this moment, you don't need to continue to remind me every other paragraph.Cristina was another strong female character that I liked right away. She is a strong character in her own right, and I kept waiting to learn more about her. She isn't in-your-face annoying and definitely doesn't detract from the main story, but enhances it in her own way, and Clare didn't over write her (the way I feel she did with Maia in TMI. I just never developed the same emotional attachment to Maia and Jordan's story as I did the main character's and I was always annoyed when I got taken away from the action, or the people I cared about to read about her annoying love drama issues). That said, SPOILER, I don't care for love triangles at all, so I'm not sure I like where the book ends and what's going on with the five teens and their love issues END SPOILER.The Blackthorn children. I understand Helen and Mark's stories, and developed an emotional connection to them at the end of TMI series. Clearly Julian is the main Blackthorn in this story, and I like him quite a bit as he's multi-dimensional, however, I feel the story could be better served by slimming the family down some more. There are a lot of kids in this story and they are mostly one-dimensional. Livvy and Ty are twins, but Livvy's sole purpose seems to be existing to give Ty a bit more sympathy from the audience. Possibly? A way to have someone help Ty navigate the world so that our two main character's aren't weighted down by it. I think Ty is great and I'm invested and care for him, but besides assisting Ty in his endeavors and begging to be his Parabatai, I don't know why she's around. To me, she slows the story down. As does Drusilla, whom I know even less about. And don't care. The story doesn't necessitate all of these characters and it's not a long enough book to get to know them all. There is only one point in the story where Drusilla remembers a useful bit of information, beyond that she is just a name that Julian mutters over and over along with his other siblings as people he's responsible for. And then there's the ""baby"" Tavvy who also exists possibly for one main purpose. Long story short, I feel the Blackthorns could have two less children and the story would have flowed better. This isn't Game of Thrones, or The Wheel of Time. Three books doesn't necessitate all of these non-essential characters that seem to be just fillers. I got tired of reading about how these Shadowhunter children couldn't needed Julian as much as they did. The twins are 15, and still being treated as babies, really. I was annoyed here.Beyond that, the story was decent. CC's other two series are definitely preferred over this one, for me, but it's still worth reading. I did find myself living for the glimpses CC would share of what was happening with the other character's that I've grown passionate about. I hope that, after all the time we've invested in TMI and ID that they end up where we all hope they'd end up when we finished those series. Happy and together the way we all ship them to be."

The lies we tell and the secrets we keep",17/10/2012,"I had a lump in my throat and pit in my stomach the entire time I was devouring this book. I've read all of Kate Morton's novels with deep satisfaction, but none of them rocked me, choked me, and held me in a mysterious state of *dread* the way this one did. I began grieving the minute I began reading. But I wouldn't put it down. It was a personal journey of self-reflection and discovery as well as a compelling story.The novel opens with a jaw-dropping vignette told with little embellishment. It reminds me of a similar birthday celebration cut short with a cake knife, the incident that changed the course of the Mortmain family's idyllic life in ""I Capture The Castle."" (A lovely classic coming-of-age drama in which, as in Morton's novels, transformation and redemption play large roles, and we are reminded that one can ""come of age"" over and over with the passage of time.) The events of that day are a climax and a begining at the same time.The story moves up and down stream from 1938 to 1941 to 1961 to 2011 without stumbling. The three main characters, Dorothy,  Vivien, and Laurel, are each classic Morton tropes: the mother with a past, the friend involved in a betrayal, and the daughter trying to find the answers that will solve a mystery and reveal her mother as a woman as well as a mum. The story belongs to Dorothy Nicolson, but it's up to her daughter Laurel to tell it.As an actress, Laurel is world famous for being able to slip into the coat of someone else's skin, to reveal what lies beneath without flaying them in grotesque caricature. We all eventually ""turn into"" our mothers but Laurel goes about it deliberately. Morton never strays too far into Laurel's professional life, keeping her moving and the narrative with her. But casting Laurel as an actress was a deliberate choice made by the author, one of many juicy literary devices employed throughout the novel.The supporting players, the men, are just as skillfully portrayed. Dorothy's first love Jimmy is uncomplicated and wholesome, an Everyman who is so easily loveable and who loves so easily. Even Jimmy's bit-player father leaves a powerful impression based purely on his presence alone. Dorothy's only son and Laurel's baby brother Gerry stands out from the ""garden"" of Nicolson daughters, not because he's the boy, or a witness or detective, but because Morton describes him so beautifully, even tenderly. Henry Jenkins is the most enigmatic of the supporting cast, but for most of the book, he should be. He is the man whose death so deeply shocks Laurel as it first flutters the carefully drawn curtains blacking out Dorothy's past. As in her other novels, the passage of time, the past, heartbreak, love, mystery, secrets, and redemption are the themes each character must struggle with. Every character, not just the leads. Everyone had their cross to bear. Which of course is true for us all. We all bring our own experience to everything we read, and perhaps that's why I've been so much more profoundly moved by this novel. To have held vigil to loved ones' slow struggle, the unique labor of dying, brought so much to bloom behind the crackling backdrop of this story. It felt as though I was battling the book, as though it was dragging bits and pieces out of me just as much as I was trying to wrench it into a whole, manageable piece. Laurel's journey to uncover her mother's secrets as she lay dying didn't feel like a race against the clock, which it so easily could have, under different author's curation. It flowed smoothly, an acceptance of the ravages of time united with the determination to sweep away as many cobwebs as possible in what little of that precious commodity remained. Morton doesn't spend too much time on minutiae, as she did in The Distant Hours, dulling what could've been a sharp tale. Here in The Secret Keeper her red-ribboned blade flashes as she deftly builds characters while moving the story forward at a gripping pace. She doles out bits and pieces like rationed boiled candy, enough to keep the reader satisfied while keeping you craving for more.This is not a beautiful novel. It is spare by Morton's standards. In sticking so closely to her characters, Morton sacrifices the beautiful sense of time and place she evoked almost too heavily in her previous works. It's like she consciously worked to shed descriptive material to focus on her characters thoughts, feelings, and reactions to each other and their environment, which is risky. Her one true outlet is through the lens of Jimmy's camera, allowing the narrative to pause to describe the horrors of the Blitz. This was a wise choice, because to understand what motivated each character, the reader needs understand something of the frenzied, fatalistic pathos that flourished amongst Londoners as the bombs rained down.In Morton's novels, the Big Mystery (the why, when, where, and how) is always paralleled with the measured discovery of the Who - the revealing details of the characters' personalities, strengths, flaws, and choices. She simultaneously fleshes out characters while flushing out the truth.There are many kinds of trials, many things to survive, many types of survivors. A common theme in Morton's work, each soul is this novel must struggle to survive their own challenges, the battles wrought by their own personalities. Even in the darkest night of the Blackout, where a sliver of light was criminal, life found a way to illuminate people's greatest flaws with harsh truths and harsher lies. Life also finds a way to grant second chances, so rare and precious that some, like Dorothy Nicolson, will never stop being grateful, and will do everything she can to make that second chance count. She dedicated herself to spreading light and locking away the dark shadows of her past. She spent time in reflection and spent time in reflecting the lessons she learned. We could all stand to do the same. We may each choose to wander in our own intentional darkness, but every now and then a book like this is a mirror focused on the reader with blinding inquisition, and all you can do is let it show you what you dare to let it. It's that infamous painful progress of life, moving you forward through time, bending and twisting you into whatever or whoever you're going to become."

a sublime and beautifully realised tale",13/11/2012,"Like all of Kate Morton's books, The Secret Keeper, a novel that is set in three different periods and follows the lives of three very different women, all linked by a terrible secret, is a rare treasure. This is because it's a story like those you used to read of old, when you were a child and believed that dreams could be fully inhabited, and that your wardrobe really could lead to other worlds, and boarding schools were invented simply to enjoy high teas with friends. This is what I think of as a rainy day novel, the type transports you out of your lounge room, off your cushion, and into another time and place; immerses you in the lives of others making you care, dislike or even love them deeply. So much so, that when the tale ends, you feel as if a little part of you has dimmed.So it is with Morton's fourth book and, in my mind, one of her best. The Secret Keeper, as the blurb on the back teases, starts in a sleepy, gentle 1961, when young Laurel, a teenager on the brink of womanhood, witnesses her mother, Dorothy, plunging a knife into a strange man's chest, killing him instantly.Propelled away from the violence and into 2011, we meet Laurel once again, this time as an accomplished actor in her sixties at the twilight of a brilliant career. Dorothy is about to turn ninety and all the children are summoned home to be beside her, knowing her days are finite and precious. One of five siblings, Laurel is the eldest and, being back with her mother conjures up memories of her past and that inexplicable day when her dreamy, imaginative mother committed a terrible crime - a crime for which she was never held accountable and which Laurel has always kept secret.As her mother's health fades, Laurel determines to uncover the secret that she has kept, to find out who the murdered man was to her mother and what prompted her parent to act in such a way. Discovering a photo she's never seen before, an inscription in a book that bears the name Vivian, Laurel is given her first clues and so, with the help of her brother, Gerard, she sets out to solve the mystery that's shrouded her entire life.This is a sublime novel that moves between 1941 and the London Blitz, to 1961 and then forward to contemporary times, shifting gently, like a soft pressure on the back, as if in a slow dance. It also segues from England to Australia and, in doing so, captures the lives and mores of different women in very different eras. Through the eyes of ambitious, romantic and fanciful Dorothy, who believes herself born to be exceptional, we come to war-torn London, where women worked in service and for their country. Physically attractive, Dorothy turns her back on her family in order to tread the path she believes the fates have carved just for her. Meeting Jimmy, a photographer with an eye for beauty and a loyal heart, she finds love, but it's when she becomes the companion of an elderly rich woman and meets her neighbour, the enigmatic and beautiful Vivian, married to a famous author, that more than fate intervenes with tragic consequences.Then, there's Vivian herself, a child of the antipodes who, through terrible circumstances finds herself in England and at the whim of cruel and dangerous forces, which work to shape and change her.From different classes and with very different outlooks on life, Laurel cannot fathom what brought her mother into Vivian's sphere or vice-a-versa, but as she slowly uncovers letters, journals and more pictures, and begins to make the connections, Laurel begins to understand that she's not the only one keeping secrets...Morton has very much made secrets, letters, memories and diaries, the never mind photographs and stories within stories part of her very female (but not so it excludes male readers, many of whom I know devour her books too) ouevre. In her gifted hands and wonderful imagination, she uses these tropes deftly and smoothly, allowing different voices to share in the story in which readers inevitably become lost.There is something lilting and magical about Morton's prose, her turn of phrase; her exquisite way of rendering the ordinary extraordinary. One example is when Dorothy (Dolly) is working for her peevish lady: `""Perish the thought,"" Dolly said, posting the boiled sweet through her mistress' pursed lips.'The simple word ""posting"" (think what else could have been used) is so perfect and transforms what Dolly is doing, making the action something you don't just read about, but witness. That's the beauty of Morton's writing - it appears effortless, flows, but words like that reveal the thought and choice that goes into every sentence. A friend of mine (a fellow writer) once wrote that she had word-envy when reading a particular author. I understand that emotion when reading Morton.What I particularly liked in this book as well is that Morton is not above giving the critics a bit of a serve. At one point in the novel, she has Laurel reflecting on her prefect childhood: ""The sort of home life that was written about by sentimental novelists in the type of books branded nostalgic by critics. (Until that whole business with the knife. That's more like it the critics would have puffed.).""Managing to be both self-aware and slightly self-deprecating at the same time she also silences those who might suggest (as some reviewers have) that Morton has become too formulaic, almost saying, what's wrong with that? Or I choose to write this way. I cheered when I read that and thought what's wrong with capturing a corner of the market like Morton has and relishing ""nostalgia"" and ""family drama"", celebrating it and making that niche your own? For this is what Morton has certainly done. Not that there's anything wrong with that - not when novels like this are produced.The Secret Keeper is best described as a delicious book. It's something you'll want to savour, to reflect upon, to appreciate for the work of literary art that it is before you return for a second and third serve. This review (and many others) also appears on my website: [...]"

My second fave Kate Morton novel",13/12/2013,"I started with THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN and loved it; unfortunately, the next two of her books were just rated ok in MY book as a result in comparison.  I then read this book last.  I read some of the negative reviews, and if nothing else, it goes to prove that 'to each his/her own.' Those complaints were ones I just didn't see as possible to describe THIS book. Someone said it was too flowery in style. I found it the complete opposite.  I was prepared to dislike it bc it was NOT written as in her previous novels, the words and passages had more of a clean, modern twist to it, but it worked for me. It held my interest, it was easy to get through, and I hated for the story to end. As with any story, on TV or in a book, you have to get thru the first quarter of the book sometimes to establish characters and set up the story. But once you get past that, you keep moving along.  Kate Morton has a lot of twists and turns and surprises in all of her novels, but I found that this one novel along with THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN did something  for me that the other two to this point I have read, did not:  I wanted to read them both over again to find the little clues I missed or glossed over, deliberately set down that way by the author in a skillful, subtle way for the reader to try to catch.  I liked this book very much.Update May 2023:  I just read this book again!  I couldn't put it down, my second time around. And it was as if I never read it the first time. I don't know how, but I enjoyed it more the second time around.  Even though bits and pieces were in my mind already, many were not, and others were further clarified. Some I had initially missed.  You feel you need to know every minute detail or you get an itch you can't scratch.  I did that the second time around when I  finished it and still had one question nagging at me; and I was feverishly going back in the earlier chapters where I knew the answer would reside and I finally found what I was looking for, a needle in the proverbial haystack.  A bit compulsive but nonetheless engaging!  I am now re-reading THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN.  It was the first novel I read from Kate Morton and the one that got me hooked.  I have read all her current novels, I still like THE SECRET KEEPER and THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN the most. I didn't love THE CLOCKMAKER'S Daughter, too many ins and outs of times and eras.  My brain was ready to explode.  I might reread THE LAKE HOUSE. I just read HOMECOMING, and I might end up reading that one again in the future.  With Kate you want another novel after each one you finish, like potato chips.I just have to say that I am amused how some reviews complain about her describing trees, flowers, bushes, and so on.  Let THEM try it.  Even a simple sentence phrased such as:  ""Curiosity revealed itself on the heels of relief.""  How many complainers could even turn a phrase  that way? It's downright poetic in its simplicity.  If they had a chance to write that passage, they'd say, 'first she was relieved, but then curious"".  There are many ways to say the same thing.  The key is, not everyone can do as well as Kate."

I don't want to ruin this very compelling story for anyone who doesn't like to know the ending, but must ask this question: Why would Henry call the strikingly beautiful woman he knew intimately 20 years earlier by the wrong name?  Of course, people do change in 20 years, but not that much unless there is excessive weight gain, which I don't recall being mentioned. The name was not written in italics or any other indication that he was being sarcastic by calling her what he did. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but can't get that little odd thing out of my mind."

Fluent Cartwheels Through a Beautiful Garden",12/06/2019,"In the autumn of 2011, I made my final purchase at Borders Bookstore.  It was a sad day, but one bright spot I take away from it is that among the three books I walked out the door for the final time with was THE DISTANT HOURS by Kate Morton, an author I had not ever read before.From the moment of opening it, I'd been immersed within its world, within its mysteries.  And before I'd been two chapters in, I realized I'd found a rare, gifted writer.  Upon the moment I finished THE DISTANT HOURS, I had acquired and then devoured both her previous novels, THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN and THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON, and they did not disappoint.  Since that time, I've considered Kate Morton among my favorite three living writers.It was only natural that I pre-order THE SECRET KEEPER for its release in the fall of 2012, and innately proper that I dive right in the moment I receive it.  The opening scene here is brilliantly set.  I can honestly say that Morton actually outdoes herself in this novel, and that every time I put the book down, I would ache to have it back again, to feel what the inhabitants herein were feeling, worry over what their fates were to be, regardless how I felt about them as ""people""-- for good or bad, they were, each of them, fully realized in this author's deft hands.The events of this story take place in three different time periods, opening in 1961 with 16-year-old Laurel witnessing a shocking event involving her mother, then to 2011 as her mother nears the end of her life, then back in time to WWII-era London, where the fates of Laurel's mother and two other people are sealed forever.  The author glides seamlessly throughout this novel between these time periods, and her voice is absolutely enchanting:""'What's this?' she said.'Nothing, really,' he said, watching as she turned it over in her hands.  'I took it for you-- last night.  It reminded me of your story, you know, the creek with the lights at the very bottom, and the people--the family on the other side of the veil.'She looked at the picture.He'd taken it as dawn was breaking; sunlight had made shards of glass in the ruins glitter and sparkle, and beyond the rising smoke you could make out the shadowy forms of the family who'd just emerged from the Anderson shelter that had saved their lives.""Like all Morton's novels, THE SECRET KEEPER will break your heart.  At the same time, it will take very good care to endear you to its own, as you marvel at the languid rhythm of its voice, and bask in the eloquence and emotion of the language."

A gifted storyteller with a richly developed story...",29/06/2023,"If interpersonal relationships and human nature combined with a historical setting/ story (in this case World War 2), Kate Morton is an author you will want to devour. The Secret Keeper is the second novel of hers that I've read, and she is now on my list of authors from whom I will purchase a book without needing to read the summary or others' comments. Her characters, settings, and details are richly developed, and she explores the intricacies of people's/character's decisions, development, & relationships in a way that makes them alive as you read. Along with Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Weiner, I will buy whatever Kate Morton writes. I know I will get transported to a different time and place to live through the eyes and thoughts of the characters and stories she's developed so well. It is well worth the time (and emotional) investment."

A LOT OF CHARACTERS, RICHLY DEVELOPED!",29/10/2014,"I had just completed another Kate Morton title, The Forgotten Garden, and wanted another rich and detailed read. I couldn't put down ""Garden,"" and loved it more than any other book in the last month or so. So, I ordered The Secret Keeper.What I found was that unlike Garden, Secret Keeper had a bit of a 'depressing' feel to it I couldn't quite shake. Not bad, not morbid or distasteful, but something I couldn't put my hand on. Maybe it was 'my mood.' Sometimes you aren't that into reading anything. But I believe that wasn't it. I found the past and present narratives just a hint confusing, too. I had to remember who was who with the minor characters, even though, as with every other Kate Morton title,they were richly developed. I loved some of them a great deal, including Jimmy's dad. The other two 'dads' got a little confusing, as they seemed to be the same man in different eras. Different nations, even.World War II was a character in the book, and I felt the shakiness (emotional and physical) of the time in Dorothy's chapters. Morton does this especially well. Her historical detail is outstanding!  I liked Jimmy, but felt his background didn't remain 'true' throughout the tales. He seemed to be too 'sophisticated' by the final chapters, which made me like him more. I do understand that he was described by Dorothy, but the point is, Dorothy was from a similar background. In the Vivian chapters he was not the very low income boy from those earlier chapters. Vivian would have noticed, I think, and probably commented on it a little at first. That threw a monkey-wrench into the 'willing suspension of disbelief.' Ditto the author husband of Vivian's descriptions.Mostly, I felt there were 'too many' characters to hold on to. THAT made it harder to fall in to each narration. Great characters, but a LOT of 'em. Large families, mostly. But also a play with too many 'parts.'So, even though I really LIKED this book, I think it might have been better with a bit of editing. Now, don't ask me who I'd have gotten of...but may be a few of the background characters might have been just that, background. Kate Morton develops these 'snapshots' of people in varied times, which she does almost TOO well! So, a 4, not a 5. Even a 4.5."

Investigating one's past",29/11/2013,"In The Secret Keeper, we are instantly put in the middle of a violent and startling event. As  a family party takes place on a warm summer afternoon, Young Laurel Nicolson has been hiding out and dreaming of the future. Upon returning homeward, she witnesses a scene that will haunt her for years to come and shake up everything she had thought about her mother. Years later, with her mother Dorothy in the final stages of life, Laurel once questions what happened so long ago, the terrible event. Determined to investigate her mother’s past, Laurel seeks not only internal solace for what she saw that day, but also an understanding of who her mother is.Morton’s novel shifts around in time, as narratives jump from the era of the World War 2 blitz in London and time before, moving forward to the present. Sections are devoted to focusing on several of the key character’s stories. In this way, The Secret Keeper uses a sort of fragmented way of eventually putting all pieces of past and present together, snapshots of key events in character’s lives are put into focus. The setting and time is captured so effectively—especially the descriptions of the World War 2 blitz—that it enhances the mood and vibe of various scenes.Morton also explores several themes eloquently: love, family, understanding one’s past, the dangers of keeping secrets. A disconnect often exists between characters’ romantic visions of life and the actual lives they lead. Part of the lesson, though, is that some hopeful and idyllic visions of life aren’t necessarily practical or genuine, or ones that would lead to ultimate happiness. There are many life lessons that Laurel understands along the way.While the book pulled me in during the last half, it felt like the first half dragged. Some scenes were a bit over the top with romance clichés—overdone romantic dialogue and scenes. I also thought some of it could have been trimmed down, too much superfluous detail. However, once Laurel starts putting the pieces of the past together, things really get moving.Over all, I enjoyed The Secret Keeper and look forward to reading another one from Kate Morton."

Absolutely Compelling",09/11/2020,"Frederick Forsyth has done an utterly amazing job again!This novel is not a conspiracy theorist's version of fiction, but a closely accurate account of the length nations go through to ensure national security.Col Martin takes you on a journey through the tumultuous history of the Middle East right up through modern times when he poses as The Afghan. He relies on spooks in the US and Great Britain to keep his mission to only 10 people, (himself being one). Using every resource, the US must keep the real Afghani prisoner hidden. The Brits will ""brush-up"" Martin's skills. Collectively, they will labor night and day to solve an impropable puzzle against a cunning enemy with sleeper cells. For his part, Col Martin must infiltrate the top tier of terror organizations who hold the closely-guarded al-Israh plot to their hearts. If allowed to carryout, it will transcend 9-11.  However, as the G8 summit approaches, will this SAS officer, who has come out of retirement, be able to pass as a Pashtun and complete Crowbar on time?Only someone with the military experience, spy background and journalism credentials like Frederick Forsyth could pen such an astute and enthralling tale!"

Very good story with good insight on the subject, by master novelist.",06/09/2014,"The tread of the story is well thought and imagery and exciting.  What I find of most interest, is that it revels information taboo in a form of novel. The present conflict in Afghanistan has its roots in the “Great Game” or the interventionism of Imperial Russia and Britain in the 19th century.The Soviet Union reinvented this game in the seventieths of last century by getting very friendly with Afghanistan and in 1978 the communists took over the government.The mother country of Islam did not take it lightly to have communist government in a Muslim state and started cooperation with the Pakistani Secret Service to funnel great mass of money to stabilize Madhhabs to radicalize young Muslims with the aim to make them mental slave, jihad soldiers.The war addict, Uncle Sam used the opportunity to aid the Mujahedeen.This radicalizing of young men have been spinning along and now the whole Muslim world is on fire, and the Gods of war are very pleased.Elías Kristjánsson.Iceland."

The Afghan gets to all your senses!",12/11/2006,"By the time you have finished the first disc of this audio book, which I might add is beautifully narrated by Robert Powell, you can't wait to get through the following eight unabridged CDs. The characters pull you in!Fredrick Forsyth, as usual, has so well researched the facts and background to his story that when you are finished you feel you have completed a short but intensive course in geography, history, language, weapons use, spy technology, maritime lore and the best types of WMD. Don't feel ashamed to take out your National Geographic maps to follow the ever twisting plot. You will have all your senses involved!Other reviewers have explained the story line....so all I can add is that if you like reading (listening) to a story that has a major dose of in-your-face current affairs with a nail-biting edge,the Afgan wins hands down. Now I can only wish somebody buys the rights to make the movie."

Unfortunately, not the Forsythe I remember!",15/09/2006,"Having read the ""Day of the Jackal"" and ""The Odessa File,"" I was hoping for another masterpiece that rivaled the early works of Ludlum.  I was disappointed and consider this an average book not up to Forsythe's early standards of excellence.  There were also glaring inaccuracies and outdated references such as GS-15 being very low on the totem pole.  Not only is it the highest grade in the GS scale (as mentioned in a previous review), but how can anyone think that a grade with 14 ranks below it would be among the lowest in rank?  Also, the GS stands for ""General Schedule"" not ""General Service.""  The SBS reference as ""Special Boat Squadron"" is incorrect and is actually ""Special Boat Service.""  The statement that the SBS only recruits those from the Royal Marines is out of date.  A little checking would have revealed that the SBS now accepts volunteers from any service.  The M21 Sniper rifle mentioned infers that this is the current weapon in the inventory when in fact it was replaced by the M24 Sniper Weapon System in 1988.  The errors could have easily been detected by professional editing and detracted from my enjoyment of the book."

Forsyth on Caffeine",31/08/2006,"That Frederick Forsyth is a master of pop international suspense thrillers is indisputable; previous works like ""The Day of the Jackal"", ""The Odessa File"", and ""The Fist of God"" set the standard for the genre.  ""The Afghan"" is another very readable, action packed tale of radical Islamism bad guys and the good guys who pursue them.  In a nutshell, Mike Martin, a retired British Special Forces Colonel with a long history of clandestine operations, is called back into action to impersonate an Afghan warlord, currently on extended vacation in Guantanamo Bay, with the goal of infiltrating Al Qaeda and determining the nature and target of a terrorist plot code-named ""Al-Isra"".  A hyperactive Forsyth takes us through a frantic tour of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the caves of Tora Bora, the first Iraq war and Guantanimo Bay, complete with cameo appearances from Osama bin Laden himself and sidekick Ayman al-Zawahiri, side trips to Indonesia, Washington state's eastern mountain ranges and even Bosnia, peppered with quick tutorials in everything from the radical Wahhabi brand of Islam to the merchant marine fleet.  Just reading it exhausted me.But if this sounds like a lot of ground to cover, it is vintage Forsyth.  And as with most Forsyth, excepting ""Day of the Jackal"", this is long on action and light on background, making for a quick and enjoyable read.  If there is a fault with ""The Afghan"", it is in the coincidence and speed of events that skip through the pages, more made-for-TV-movie than LeCarre.  Ultimately it is a story more chilling in the likelihood of the occurrence of an ""Al-Isra-like"" event than as a result of Forsyth's plot or prose.Notwithstanding, this is a reliable end-of-summer page-turner and, if not up to the standards of some earlier Forsyth work, definitely worth the effort.  For another recent release with a more realistic and equally chilling installment on the war on radical Islam, I'd highly recommend ""The Messenger"" by David Silva, a more intricately drawn drama with a keener insight into the challenges - and unlikelihood - of solving the problem anytime soon."

A Gripping Adventure",21/08/2007,"Frederick Forsyth is known for his political thrillers and this one is sure to keep up his reputation. It tells a believable story of an Al Qaeda plot to outdo the 911 tragedy. In doing so, it manages to teach a bit of history, distinguish between fanatics and ordinary people, rely on story telling instead of technical fixes and be entertaining at the same time. It is also quite chilling.When the west gets a hint of a plot to make 911 look trivial, they are hampered by not knowing exactly what the plot is. All that is known is that it exists. In order to combat it, though, more information is needed and that is a problem. Getting a highly placed agent into Al Qaeda is not a trivial or a safe undertaking. Even so, a plot is hatched and the perfect agent is found. Now the hard part begins. The plot must be unraveled, it must be communicated to Washington and London and it must be stopped. Any slipup will mean a terrible death not only for the agent but for the victims as well.As the plot thickens, the tension does as well in the all-too-believable thriller. Its not his best but it is good."

Often this is because author Charlaine Harris has written a short story that covers some important event(s) that happens between the books. These shorts were originally published in short story collections by a variety of authors, and appear here in chronological order.""Fairy Dust"" takes place after the novel Dead To The World (Sookie Stackhouse #4), and occurs when Claudine and Claude ask Sookie to help them figure out who killed their sister, Claudette. In ""Dracula Night"", which takes place before Dead As A Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse #5), Eric is hoping that the original modern vampire will show up to his annual Dracula birthday party. (Pam hilariously likens it to 'It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown'). In ""One Word Answer"" Sookie finds out that her cousin Hadley has died and named her the executor of her will. The events in this story lead directly to happenings in Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #6). ""Lucky"" takes place after All Together Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #7), and is a fun excursion for Sookie and her witch friend, Amelia, as they try to figure out who has broken into Sookie's insurance agent's office. The last story, ""Gift Wrap"", takes place before Dead And Gone (Sookie Stackhouse #9), when she is pretty bummed about her Christmas alone -- the second since her grandmother died. But of course it can't be that uneventful! Instead she hears moaning in the woods and decides to go check it out, which leads her to an altogether different Christmas than she'd expected.This is a fun collection and adds to one's enjoyment of the books.

Perfect for every Sookie fan!",06/10/2009,"This book is an excellent addition to the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series. The author Charlaine Harris had published these short stories, but in different anthology books, and this book was the best (and cheapest) way to read them all in one item.The book starts with an introduction by Harris, who tells us about the stories. ""A Touch of Dead"" includes five of them: Fairy Dust, Dracula Night, One Word Answer, Lucky, and Gift Wrap. The connection of time frame of these short stories range from post-book 4 (Dead to the World) to post-book 9 (From Dead to Worst). Most of the stories are not directly tied to the Sookie series, except ""One Word Answer,"" which is essential to new readers of the books. This is a key story that occurs right before book 6, ""Definitely Dead."" Just to be clear, ""A Touch of Dead"" does not include any other of Harris' short stories.Each short story has an illustration, which I love. All of them were made by Lisa Desimini, who had been doing this since the first Sookie book, ""Dead until Dark."" They are all brand new, since the short stories did not have any drawings when previously published.This is not a new Sookie Stackhouse serial book (the tenth one will be out in May 2010), but if you want a new item for your Sookie collection, this is a must!"

But I love the Sookie series, surely this book cannot be THAT bad.  And it wasn't.The negative -The title is horrible.  The complete stories?  Yes, I agree with the complaints.  Especially for people setting out to discover the world of Sookie, this could be misleading.It's short.  Five short stories to be exact.They've all been published before, in anthologies.  Many fans seem to have read some or all of them before.The positive -Despite the title, the description is accurate.  If you look beyond the title, you'll know just what you're getting.So it's just five short stories.  They're all Sookie.  The reason I've never  read any of them before now? I had no interest in buying the anthologies that they appeared in until now.  I own one anthology that has a Charlaine Harris story in it (not a Sookie story).  I've found anthologies hit and miss, so I don't tend to buy them.  But this is all of the Sookie short stories, in one place.  Just what I wanted.I'd always felt as though I were missing out on the story of Sookie's cousin.  I knew there was a short story out there somewhere.  Now I have it.  We'd been filled in on this story in the novels, so it's not something we had to read.  Still, it was nice to read the actual text where the events originally took place anyway.Charlaine Harris herself starts the book out by telling us how daunting a task it is to take such a complicated series of characters and be asked to write short stories featuring them.  Of the five stories, were some better than others?  Of course.  But the same can be said of the novel length stories.  None were so horrible that I'd give them 1 star.  They were all definitely true to Sookie.  Still, this is only for the true fan, who has read the other books, and who wants a little filler while waiting for the next novel.  If you're new to the Sookie/Southern Vampire/True Blood books, don't start here."

This book of short stories will probably hold me over until her next book comes out.Yes, I knew it was short stories as opposed to another Sookie novel, because I actually read the discription.

Even the Amazon title says ""A Touch of Dead (Sookie Stackhouse: The Complete Stories"".  STORIES.  As in ""short stories.""  Giving this book one star simply because it's exactly what it says it is is absolutely ludicrous.That said, I'm glad I got this book.  I had read all but two of the stories before, in various anthologies, and I'm glad to have them collected into one volume that I can stick on the shelf with the rest of my Sookie collection.  ""One Word Answer"" is especially a story that's pretty vital to the series as a whole, since it details the fate that befell Hadley (the aftermath of which is dealt with in 
Definitely Dead: A Sookie Stackhouse Novel (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)
.  The other stories were fun little snippets of life with Sookie, and I loved reading and re-visiting them.I do wish it were a little more ""complete"" as the title says.  While these may be all the anthology stories that feature Sookie herself, there are others that take place in the Sookieverse that were left out.  Sean and Layla's story is detailed in a great story called ""Dancers in the Dark"" which features in the anthology 
Night's Edge: Dancers in the Dark\Her Best Enemy\Someone Else's Shadow
.  It's a very sweet, exciting, romantic story, and it would have been great to have it in this collection, especially as they have a cameo appearance in 
All Together Dead (Southern Vampire Mysteries, Book 7)
.  And there are at least two more I remember reading - one about a female vampire and one about weres - that take place in the same ""universe"".  Why not throw in those stories too, to make this book a more complete ""Sookieverse"" anthology?  I think the hardback cover price would be a little more justified then, without having to use such a large font to increase the page count.So all in all, I'm glad I got this, but I'm a little disappointed because it could have been much more than it is."

Loved it!  Wish it was longer!",17/07/2010,"If you are a fan of the HBO show, or of the Sookie Stackhouse books, you will enjoy this book.There are already descriptions of the time frame for each story, and these seem to be tales that just didn't quite fit into the tone of the other books.They are great at adding information though, and much more ""stand alone"" than the author's normal style, which often includes page turning cliff hangers and a need for ""what will happen now?""I'd buy it just for the expanded tale about the fairies, but I enjoyed each of the stories quite a bit.  The endings were unlike Ms. Harris' normal style, so a tad jarring at first, but quite satisfying at the same time.If you think of the series of books as a continuous delicious feasts, then these stories are the lovely little special treats offered from a dessert cart at the end, a perfectly ripe Belgian chocolate covered strawberry here, a creme brulee there, homemade coconut ice cream in a cookie shell over there, and all kinds of little goodies to enjoy.I'd give it five stars, but for such a slim volume, the price was a tad high, still, it was fun and informative, and filled in some lovely blanks.  The stories, though certainly set in the same situations as the books, do not always jive with the actions in the ""real"" books.  That didn't bother me, but it might bother some.For example, in one story, Sookie meets the queen under quite different circumstances.  Hadley's death is also different.  I looked at it as a glimpse into various options Ms. Harris considered whilst creating her world.I just wish we had a few more stories in the book!"

Pretty satisfying collection of shorter stories",29/09/2010,"For fans of Sookie Stackhouse, this is an intriguing collection of short stories. I had wondered if short stories could capture some of the atmosphere of the novels. In the end, though, this works fairly well.At one level, they provide more context for episodes in the novels, such as the story of the three fairies--Claude, Claudine, Claudette (down to two after this short story). We get a bit more depth here about characters showing up in the novels.Other short stories, such as ""Dracula Night"" are more ""stand alone"" stories. Here, we wonder if the visitor at a vampire party is the real Dracula or an imposter. This is unrelated to the novels but a nice little bon bon. We meet some of Sookie's friends such as Pam and Eric Northman. And we see Sookie extricate herself from being a meal for ""Dracula.""A short story about the murder of Hadley, Sookie's cousin who had been turned into a vampire. She had been murdered and this short story gets at the truth as to her death. We are also introduced to the Queen of Louisiana.What if a witch were an insurance salesman and used spells to keep bad things from happening to his customers? This delightful short story explores that premise. Sookie's witch friend, Amelia, is encountered in this story.Throughout the short stories here, we also meet a number of old friends, including Bubba, Bill, Sam, Amelia (the witch), Mr. Cataliades, and so on.Anyhow, a nice set of shorter works about Sookie."

A Touch of Fun",12/10/2010,"I figured I could pass on this compilation of short stories based on the the Sookie Stackhouse books because 1) I'm not a fan of short stories, and 2) I didn't think there'd be much substance there. But based on the recommendation of two reading buddies (Hi, Steven and Karen!), I decided that maybe I was missing something after all, so I picked it up. It turns out that A Touch of Dead is the perfect light companion to the fuller stories, and fills in some of the gaps as well. Mission accomplished!There are five short stories contained in A Touch of Dead, and each takes place at different stages of the Sookie adventures. While all of them are fun, my favorite was One Word Answer because it seemed to give us the most background into Sookie's relationship with her cousin Hadley. Fairy Dust focuses on Sookie helping Claudine and Claude find out who murdered their triplet, Claudette; Dracula Night finds us at Fangtastia awaiting the arrival of the Count himself; Lucky is a bit a of throwaway story where Sookie and Amelia help out a local insurance agent; and Gift Wrap details a rather interesting Christmas Eve.It would, of course, help to be very familiar with Sookie's stories before reading A Touch of Dead, and to keep your expectations low as far as plot advancement goes. But if you're as eager to spend time in the fun-filled life of our Sookie, A Touch of Dead more than fits the bill."

Touch of Dead - Great Book",12/11/2009,"This is very a good book of short stories. I knew what I was getting when I ordered it and that it wasn't going to be a continuation of the regular Sookie Stackhouse series. The stories give you a different inset into each character on how they exist outside the main canon storyline. It is great to see how they are and react to things during the down times in between the main books. I enjoy reading anything by Ms. Harris, whether short story or story series. Many authors or in some cases their publishers put their short stories into one volume even if they had been released in other books.To those who feel let down or conned you should have done your research into this book before buying it. I was caught off guard when I first saw the book posted for pre-order and it said book 10. I thought it was strange that they were releasing the new book that quickly since they always got released in May. I opened it up and saw that it wasn't book 10 but the short story collection. It was spelled out in back and white in the description. So no one should blame Ms. Harris for this but Amazon for how they did their promotion of it."

Breezy stories with little insight",15/10/2013,"""A touch of dead"" promises to give us a few Sookie events not covered in the novels.  I was one of those readers who wanted ""every last sip of Sookie"" as the book says, but after reading it I've decided to skip the rest of the short stories and just read the novels.  While I wasn't expecting big revelations, nothing here actually surprised me for being good or clever, and one story in particular surprised me by how far fetched it was.  Here's the review for each one:""Fairy dust"" - A lighthearted whodunnit where fairy siblings Claude and Claudine ask for Sookie's help in determining who killed their sister.  It was funny at times and it kept me guessing, but overall it was forgettable and didn't add anything to the story.""Dracula night"" - This was the biggest offender for me.  It was a weird homage to ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"", mixed with the story of Dracula and the Southern vampire characters.  It wasn't particularly funny and Eric seemed off suddenly fangirling for Dracula because it was the first modern vampire.  It ended up being confusing and it read like fan fiction.""One word answer"" - The only story that reveals something about the series plot.  We find Sookie discovering her cousin's Hadley's death.  This story shows the events that lead into ""Definitely dead"" and it could have worked as a chapter.  It was more somber than the others but it was still entertaining because it was thrilling.  That said, if you don't read it, don't think you're missing a big chunk of story.""Lucky"" - Another lighthearted mystery in with Sookie and Amelia Broadway.  It had the same qualities as ""Fairy dust"", entertaining but forgettable.""Giftwrap"" - This one veered more into romance than mystery.  It was interesting watching Sookie as she spent Christmas Eve alone and how she felt.  The outcome of the story was amusing but Charlaine Harris has the talent to come up with something more creative than that."

sookie and short stories -- good match!",19/10/2009,"I loved Sookie before she was a famous TV star and even more after I adjusted.  Her blend of manners, southern upbringing and outer and inner dialog contrast nicely to the dark and sometimes unpleasant things that happen to her.  Sookie's special skills are episodic.  She lives in a small town and wants to stay there and at peace with her neighbors, even when they are jerks to her.  Short stories and small towns -- just about right for each other, unlike Sookie and her men so far.  I also remembered well where these events might fit into the story line, something I don't always manage in the books and the series (""is she mad at Bill here or still happy?"")  The downer reviews from buyers unhappy about length and price are misleading.  Let's not let some marketing quibbles turn us off a really good showing for Sookie and Charlaine! I hope there are more Sookie short stories in all our futures."

Don't expect too much",21/01/2010,"My sister gave me the first four Sookie books for Christmas and I became an instant addict, finishing those and then whipping through the next four all in two weeks.  Point being, I'm normally a huge fan.  This collection was a disappointment.  These stories don't stand alone well--if you haven't read the novels you are sure to be confused  while trying to figure out all the previous history.  (However; if you are a fan of the books, the awkwardly forced exposition takes up way too much time in these very short stories.)  Charlaine Harris has created a world that is simply too full to easily fit into a short story. The result is stories that feel thin; incomplete; and, most disappointing and preventable, often don't ring true to the established spirit of the characters.Take away messages:1)If you are a  Stackhouse fan nothing is going to stop you from reading this collection because it exists and you are anxiously awaiting anything Sookie.  Go in with low expectations, and take the advice of other reviewers and borrow it from the library or a friend.2)If this collection was your introduction into Sookie's world and you were disappointed please, please don't give up.  They novels are a much different experience, give them a try!"

I think I set my hopes a little too high...",06/10/2009,"This book fell a bit short of my expectations. I had been hoping for some type of sneak-peek or short story taking place after the events of 
Dead And Gone (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood, Book 9)
, but these short stories all take place before the events of 
Dead And Gone (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood, Book 9)
 - some set as early as the fourth book! They were all fun to read, and I am definitely looking forward to re-reading the series with the short stories in the right chronological order once the series ends. This was a fast read, and now it will be a long wait until the next book comes out! Also, I must admit, I was a bit disappointed with the pre-order delivery times for the Kindle. It came at 2:00 AM CST, when I had been hoping for at least 12:00 AM."

fills in a few gaps",23/02/2011,"I like the series even though in general the entire thing is riddled with inconsistencies and gaps. I've tended to ignore these minor issues even though a couple really bugged me. I thought this book might fill in some of the gaps based on some reviews I read. The good news is that yes, this book of short stories fills in the two biggest gaps that have bugged me.  I was pleased to read the story that brought the queen of louisiana to sookies house to explain her cousins death (the best short story in the book in my opinion and thats not saying much).  I was slightly confused in the regular book series when this meeting is just briefly explained as a past incident.  For the longest time, I thought I completely read something out of sequence because I didn't realize these short stories were happening.  Second you get a brief glimpse of the christmas sookie mentions spending with her great grandfather in the last book released.  While I was happy to see these gaps filled in, overall I thought the majority of stories were pretty poor and didn't hold true to the regular books.  I guess overall I'm happy to have read these stories, but really wish I would have checked out the book from the library rather than buy it."

Just OK",15/10/2009,"Let me start by saying to all of the rabid (and in many cases, hostile) Charlaine Harris fans, my jump to buy this book without reading the entire description was my bad...and truthfully is a testimony to how much I enjoy these books.  I saw the cover, did not check the release date or description, and pre-ordered it.  A flaw that an avid reader like myself has done before once I started ordering books on-line. So please, don't attack me!That said, my review is strictly based on the stories themselves.  And frankly, they did not add that much to the storyline, and did not fill the withdrawal I'm feeling waiting for Book 10.I will say though, as someone who's a Marketing Major, the design of the cover and title did not scream ""supplemental book"" (still taking responsibility here).  And any Marketing person worth his/her pay check could easily anticipate that some confusion (and ultimately, disappointment) would occur if this format was used versus a format similar to the Bite or Wolfsbane books."

A little thin...",07/10/2009,"I knew that this was a compilation of Sookie short stories and I was really excited about that.  Shame on reviewers for giving the book a low review because they did not do their research and thought they were getting a full book in the series.  I loved the idea of all the short stories put together- as a reader new to the series I love everything Bill and Sookie and definitely did not want to have to hunt through several different collections.However....I think Charlaine Harris needed a few more stories before putting together a hardback book to sell- 5 is pretty slim.  Now I guess I could have done MY homework and known that is how many she had written!  :)The stories are fun and fill in the blanks between the books very nicely, particularly the one that deals with cousin Hadley's death.  Fans of the series will certainly enjoy just a taste while we wait for Book 10, ""Dead in teh Family.""  But definitely check with your library or a friend; this is not worth buying."

Finding your place",18/06/2023,"We each want to find our place in the world.  Some children deal with trauma, and a few deal with trauma upon trauma.  For Daja, surviving is awful, depriving her not only of her family, but also separating her from her cultural group.  Pierce weaves a rich world of many religions and languages, customs and beliefs, but this is a story of celebrating diversity and finding yourself even in the most trying of times.  The people who cast you out may start to value you, may want you back… and maybe you want that, or maybe you need to be who you are.  I read this as a preteen, revisit as an adult, and share with any child old enough to sit still and listen or read for themself."

The Circle of Magic Continues: Daja's Book (#3)",19/05/2014,"The four friends, possessors of wild magic, continue the process of learning how to use and control their magics; their teachers/mentors, continue their own quest: to understand the power (particularly the combined power) of these youngsters. In this novel, they are all traveling with Sandry's uncle, the Prince, as he surveys the problems of his lands. In particular, the kingdom they are visiting is suffering from a severe drought and is plagued with raging fires. The resident mage, university trained in traditional methods of magic, is fiercely possessive of his power to control fires, but is showing signs of stress and fatigue. When he dies during a sudden outbreak of high crown fires, all the mages, both mentors and mentees, must collaborate to save people's lives; in particular, Tris--who has been banished from any contact with her people, the Traders--must find new power and control when a fire threatens the Traders' caravan as it is departing.  Although this book focuses most heavily on Daja, she shares the stage with Briar, Tris, and Sandry, and we the readers continue to learn more about these great characters. I love the diversity of Pierce's characters: a mix of male and female heroes, coming from an astonishing range of economic and ethnic backgrounds. She does not brush aside the real problems that their differences can create, but she does show how experience and relationships can lead to new, stronger ties.  A worthy number 3 for this series: don't miss it!"

It is a great change of pace to explore the world beyond Summersea and the descriptions of the drought and the fires are extremely evocative. The Trader culture was portrayed in a fascinating fashion, and I loved Daja's complex relationship with her culture and her past. Polyam was also a cool character, and it was refreshing to see a character with a disability play a prominent role and not be reduced to simplicity. The mage responsible for putting out the fires was also bitter without being totally unsympathetic."

This is a fantastic series... I've read it more than once.",06/04/2014,"Even though these books are meant for young adults, I would recommend them to adult fans of fantasy and adventure as well. While properly classified as fantasy, they have a novel-like feel to them, and the fact that they are in series is also a plus to me - I'm one of those folks that always wonders what happens to the other characters when the novel ends! The characters are very well developed and consistent across all of the books, and while the endings are always more or less happy, there is a lot of sadness and emotion along the way. The main characters come from diverse backgrounds, and have all had some serious obstacles to overcome - racism and class perception issues among them. Very well done!"

""Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do."" It was as if he were suggesting themes for his biography (and in this instance, at least, the theme turned out to be valid). The creativity that can occur where both the humanities and the sciences combine in one strong personality was the topic that most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating innovative economies in the twenty-first century.""2- ""His wife also did not request restrictions or control, nor did she ask to see in advance what I would publish. In fact she strongly encouraged me to be honest about his failings as well as his strengths. She is one of the smartest and most grounded people I have ever met. ""There are parts of his life and personality that are extremely messy. and that's the truth,"" she told me early on. ""You shouldn't whitewash it. He's good at spin, but he also has a remarkable story, and I'd like to see that it's all told truthfully"" I leave it to the reader to assess whether I have succeeded in this mission. I'm sure there are players in this drama who will remember some of the events differently or think that I sometimes got trapped in Jobs's distortion field.""3- ""Jobs said that his appreciation for Eichler homes instilled in him a passion for making nicely designed products for the mass market. I Jove it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn't cost much,"" he said as he pointed out the clean elegance of the houses. ""It was the original vision for Apple. That's what we tried to do with the first Mac. That's what we did with the iPod.""""4- ""The Blue Box adventure established a template for a partnership that would soon be born. Wozniak would be the gentle wizard coming up with a neat invention that he would have been happy just to give away. and Jobs would figure out how to make it user-friendly, put it together in a package, market it, and make a few bucks.""5- ""Coming back to America was, for me, much more of a cultural shock than going to India. The people in the Indian countryside don't use their intellect like we do, they use their intuition instead, and their intuition is far more developed than in the rest of the world. Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion. That's had a big impact on my work.""6- ""Jobs is a complex person, he said, and being manipulative is just the darker facet of the traits that make him successful. Wozniak would never have been that way, but as he points out, he also could never have built Apple. ""I would rather let it pass,"" he said when I pressed the point. ""It's not something I want to judge Steve by.""""7- ""Apple. It was a smart choice. The word instantly signaled friendliness and simplicity. It managed to be both slightly off-beat and as normal as a slice of pie. There was a whiff of counterculture, back-to-nature earthiness to it, yet nothing could be more American. And the two words together—Apple Computer—provided an amusing disjuncture.

Jobs applied that to the layout of the circuit board inside the Apple II. He rejected the initial design because the lines were not straight enough. This passion for perfection led him to indulge his instinct to control. Most hackers and hobbyists liked to customize, modify, and jack various things into their computers. To Jobs, this was a threat to a seamless end-to-end user experience.""9-  ""Markkula would become a father figure to Jobs. Like Jobs's adoptive father, he would indulge Jobs's strong will, and like his biological father, he would end up abandoning him. ""Markkula was as much a father-son relationship as Steve ever had,"" said the venture capitalist Arthur Rock. He began to teach Jobs about marketing and sales. ""Mike really took me under his wing,"" Jobs recalled. ""His values were much aligned with mine. He emphasized that you should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be making something you believe in and making a company that will last.""""10- ""Was Jobs's unfiltered behavior caused by a lack of emotional sensitivity? No. Almost the opposite. He was very emotionally attuned. able to read people and know their psychological strengths and vulnerabilities. He could stun an unsuspecting: victim with an emotional towel-snap, perfectly aimed. He intuitively knew when someone was faking it or truly knew something. This made him masterful at cajoling, stroking, persuading, flattering, and intimidating people.""11- ""But even though Jobs's style could be demoralizing, it could also be oddly inspiring. It infused Apple employees with an abiding passion to create groundbreaking products and a belief that they could accomplish what seemed impossible.""12- ""The best products, he believed, were ""whole widgets"" that were designed end-to-end, with the software closely tailored to the hardware and vice versa. This is what would distinguish the Macintosh, which had an operating system that worked only on its own hardware, from the environment that Microsoft was creating, in which its operating system could be used on hardware made by many different companies.""13- ""Their differences in personality and character would lead them to opposite sides of what would become the fundamental divide in the digital age. Jobs was a perfectionist who craved control and indulged in the uncompromising temperament of an artist; he and Apple became the exemplars of a digital strategy that tightly integrated hardware. software, and content into a seamless package. Gates was a smart, calculating, and pragmatic analyst of business and technology; he was )pen to licensing Microsoft's operating system and software to a variety of manufacturers.""14- ""I'll always stay connected with Apple. I hope that throughout my life I'll sort of have the thread of my life and the thread of Apple weave in and out of each other, like a tapestry. There may be a few years when I'm not there, but I'U always come back. If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you've done and whoever you were and throw them away. The more the outside world tries to reinforce an image of you, the harder it is to continue to be an artist, which is why a lot of times. artists have to say. ""Bye. I have to go  now. I'm going crazy and I'm getting out of here."" And they go and hibernate somewhere. Maybe later they re-emerge a little differently.""15- ""Jobs sometimes avoided the truth. Helmut Sonnenfeldt once said of Henry Kissinger, ""He lies not because it's in his interest. he lies because it's in his nature."" It was in Jobs's nature to mislead or be secretive when he felt it was warranted. But he also indulged in being brutally honest at times, telling the truths that most of us sugarcoat or suppress. Both the dissembling and the truth-telling were simply different aspects of his Nietzschean attitude that ordinary rules didn't apply to him.""16- ""For all of his willfulness and insatiable desire to control things. Jobs was indecisive and reticent when he felt unsure about something. He craved perfection, and he was not always good at figuring out how to settle for something less. He did not like to wrestle with complexity or make accommodations. This was true in products, design, and furnishings for the house. It was also true when it came to personal for the house. It was also true when it came to personal commitments. If he knew for sure a course of action was right. he was unstoppable. But if he had doubts, he sometimes withdrew, preferring not to think about things that did not perfectly suit him.""17- ""Ever since he left the apple commune, Jobs had defined himself and by extension Apple, as a child of the counterculture. In ads such as ""Think Different"" and ""1984,"" he positioned the Apple brand so that it reaffirmed his own rebel streak, even after he became a billionaire, and it allowed other baby boomers and their kids to do the same. ""From when I first met him as a young guy, he's had the greatest of the impact he wants his brand to have on people,"" said Clow. Very few other companies or corporate leaders—perhaps none— could have gotten away with the brilliant audacity of associating their brand with Gandhi, Einstein, Picasso, and the Dalai Lama. Jobs was able to encourage people to define themselves as anti-corporate, creative. innovative rebels simply by the computer they used. ""Steve created the only lifestyle brand in the tech industry,"" Larry Ellison said. ""There are cars people are proud to have—Porsche, Ferrari, Prius—because what I drive says something about me. People feel the same way about an Apple product.""18- ""One of his motivating passions was to build a lasting company. At age twelve, when he got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard, he learned that a properly run company could spawn innovation far more than any single creative individual. ""I discovered that the best innovation is sometimes the company, the way you organize a company,"" he recalled. ""The whole notion of how you build a company is fascinating. When I got the chance to come back to Apple, I realized that I would be useless without the company, and that's why I decided to stay and rebuild it.""19- ""Why do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products. we have to feel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity, you find a way to make the product defer to you. Simplicity isn't just a -visual style. It's not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. X involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to understand everything about it and how it's manufactured. You have to deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get rid of the parts that are not essential.""20- ""Despite his autocratic nature—he never worshiped at the altar of consensus—Jobs worked hard to foster a culture of collaboration at Apple. Many companies pride themselves on having few meetings. Jobs had many.""21- """"From the earliest days at Apple, I realized that we thrived when we created intellectual property. If people copied or stole our software, we'd be out of business. If it weren't protected, there'd be no incentive for us to make new software or product designs. If protection of intellectual property begins to disappear, creative companies will disappear or never get Started. But there's a simpler reason: It's wrong to steal. It hurts other people. And it hurts your own character.""  He knew, however, that the best way to stop piracy—in fact the only way—was to offer an alternative that was more attractive than the brain-dead services that music companies were concocting.""22- ""But Sony couldn't. It had pioneered portable music with the Walkman, it had a great record company, and it had a long history of making beautiful consumer devices. It had all of the assets to compete with Jobs's Strategy of integration of hardware, software, devices, and content sales. Why did it fail? Partly because it was a company, like AOL Time Warner that was organized into divisions (that word itself was ominous) with their own bottom lines; the goal of achieving synergy in such companies by prodding the divisions to work together was usually elusive. Jobs did not organize Apple into semi-autonomous divisions; he closely controlled all of his teams and pushed them to work as one cohesive and flexible company, with one profit-and-loss bottom fine. ""We don't have 'divisions' with their own P&L,"" said Tim Cook. ""We run one P&L for the company.""""23- ""Despite being- a denizen of the digital world, or maybe because he knew all too well its isolating potential, Jobs was a strong believer in face-to-face meetings. ""There's a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by email and iChat,"" he said. ""That's crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they're doing, you say 'Wow,' and soon you're cooking up all sorts of ideas."" So he had the Pixar building- designed to promote encounters and unplanned collaborations. ""If a building doesn't encourage that, you'll lose a lot of innovation and the magic that's sparked by serendipity,"" he said. ""So we designed the building to make people get out of their offices and mingle in the central atrium with people they might not otherwise see.""""24- ""Jobs insisted that Apple focus on just two or three priorities at a time. ""There is no one better at turning off the noise that is going on around him,"" Cook said. ""That allows him to focus on a few things and say no to many things. Few people are really good at that."" In order to institutionalize the lessons that he and his team were learning. Jobs started an in-house center called Apple University. He hired Joel Podolny, who was dean of the Yale School of Management, to compile a series of case studies analyzing important decisions the company had made, including the switch to the Intel microprocessor and  the decision to open the Apple Stores. Top executives spent time teaching the cases to new employees, so that the Apple style of decision making would be embedded in the culture.""25- """"Steve has a particular way that he wants to run Apple, and it's the same as it was twenty years ago, which is that Apple is a brilliant innovator of closed systems."" Schmidt later told me. ""They don't want people to be on their platform without permission. The benefits of a closed platform is control. But Google has a specific belief that open is the better approach, because it leads to more options and competition and consumer choice.""""26- ""The nasty edge to his personality was not necessary. It hindered him more than it helped him. But it did, at times, serve a purpose. Polite and velvety leaders, who take care to avoid bruising others, are generally not as effective at forcing change. Dozens of the colleagues whom Jobs most abused ended their litany of horror stories by saying that he got them to do things they never dreamed possible. And he created a corporation crammed with A players.""27- ""The saga of Steve Jobs is the Silicon Valley creation myth writ large: launching a start-up in his parents' garage and building it into the world's most valuable company. He didn't invent many things outright. but he was a master at putting together ideas, art, and technology in ways that invented the feature. He designed the Mac after appreciating the power of graphical interfaces in a way that Xerox was unable to do. and he created the iPod after grasping the joy of having a thousand in your pocket in a way that Sony, which had all the assets and heritage, never could accomplish. Some leaders push innovations by being good at the big picture. Others do so by mastering details. Jobs did both, relentlessly. As a result he launched a series of products over three decades that transformed whole industries...""28- ""Was he smart? No, not exceptionally. Instead, he was a genius. His imaginative leaps were instinctive, unexpected, and at times magical. He was, indeed, an example of what the mathematician Mark Kac called a magician genius, someone whose insights come out of the blue and require intuition more than mere mental processing power. Like a pathfinder, he could absorb information, sniff the winds, and sense what lay ahead. Steve Jobs thus became the greatest business executive of our era, the one most certain to be remembered a century from now. History will place him in the pantheon right next to Edison and Ford. More than anyone else of his time, he made products that were completely innovative, combining the power of poetry and processors. With a ferocity that could make working with him as unsettling as it was inspiring, he also built the world's most creative company. And he was able to infuse into its DNA the design sensibilities, perfectionism, and imagination that make it likely to be, even decades from now. the company that thrives best at the intersection of artistry and technology."""

Jobs is a Four Letter Word",08/01/2012,"Many people might mistake this book for a mere biography of the man that made Apple a household name and its products coveted by millions around the world. It's not.This book is actually three books in one. It's a business book on how to (and not to) run a company using Apple, NeXT and Pixar as case studies. It's also a history book on the ascent and the drama behind the consumer electronics evolution. And as its title suggests, it's the fascinating story of one of the most gifted people of our time.As a business book, Isaacson writes about three distinct business practices. The first is how to really create a company from scratch. The passion exuded by Jobs and Wozniak is detailed with infectious enthusiasm in the first half of the book.The second practice (and one often not talked about in business books) is how to drive a company to the ground. The book is rife with examples of internal politics, lack of leadership and the absence of focus that truly illustrate how companies fail.The last practice is how to build and operate a creative company that endures. For me, this is the most fascinating narrative of all. But to fully appreciate it, one must truly understand the first two, which almost always precede this one.The book offers a great case study of three companies: Apple, NeXT and Pixar. One fascinating vignette in the book draws a contrast between Apple and Sony and why Apple was successful in conquering the consumer-end of the music business while Sony, who was in a favorable position to do exactly that, failed to do so. This story draws attention to the importance of inter-departmental cohesion that Apple possessed and Sony didn't, to the success of innovation in a company.Business leaders reading this book will learn a lot about the power of ""focus"" in business. Steve Jobs's most doled out advice was ""focus."" Throughout the book, we learn how Jobs followed his own advice to a deadly fault.As a business book, it is amongst the best.It's also an even better history book. It details the ascent of personal computing from the perspective of the very people that were (and still are) at its helm. The book doesn't only cover Apple's evolution, but that of the entire industry. Naturally, that involves drama, which Isaacson does a great job of covering. The philosophical divide between open and closed systems that dominated the personal computing evolution is discussed thoroughly in the book via anecdotal accounts on what really happened behind the scenes. It explains what it really took to bring us the products on which I read this book and now writing its review.Most importantly, this is a very personal book. It is the story of man adored by millions of geeks, and when departed, mourned by hundreds of millions of Apple consumers around the world. Unfortunately, a devastating portrait that is guaranteed to put out any respect or admiration you've ever had for the man emerges early on in the book. If you have spent the last fifteen years romanticizing about Steve Jobs and his products, this book will leave you punch-drunk. You will learn through stomach-churning details how Steve Jobs was a disloyal, lying, backstabbing, vindictive, manipulative, vengeful, and all-around vile and damaged human being. He was, and surprisingly so, a coward, as clearly illustrated by how he treated people in his twenties and thirties.And oh, he cried a lot. I mean, A LOT.The book is rife with examples of his cruelty towards those who he seemed to have loved the most. His treatment of Steve Wozniak was unconscionable and disgusting. But the most disturbing example and the one that really shows his character was how he treated his ""soul mate"" from Reed College, Daniel Kottke. I could sum it up by quoting John Scully's wife when she told Jobs:When I look into most people's eyes, I see a soul. When I look into your eye, I see a bottomless pit, an empty hole, a dead zone.Even the amiable, most trusting co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, who's been backstabbed by Jobs several times, have said about Jobs, ""I look forward to a great product and I wish him success, but his integrity I cannot trust.""The irony in Steve Jobs story was that he loathed people that treated him the way he treated others. He had to deal with a few people that gave him a run for his money like Eisner of Disney and Katzenburg of DreamWorks. He claims throughout the book that he's ""honest"" and a ""straightshooter"" yet all the stories relayed by people that had to deal with him tell a completely different story.For a control freak, it boggles me how he allowed such a book to be written about him. Now we all know that he might have been a visionary, but he was also a very disturbed man void of compassion, empathy and integrity.As I got deeper into the book I started to wonder, ""did Apple offer on-campus Al-Anon meetings to its employees?"" Evidently, working for or with Steve Jobs was like being in a relationship with a recovering Cocaine addict who sees the world in black and white and throws frequent tantrums that are aimed at destroying those around them. It's what Mike Murray, Apple's Marketing Chief, called, ""management by character assassination.""Jobs quotes Bob Dylan, whom we learn early in the book was one of his heroes, ""if you're not busy being born, you're busy dying."" It's ironic to quote those powerful words and not heed them. The book clearly shows that Steve Jobs was never really reborn or reinvented as a person. He never evolved and his base qualities were never tamed. Naturally, he spent his entire life dying from the inside out.The book left me enriched, provoked and sad in equal measure. It is long but flows well and is a fast read. All business executives should read it for the insight it offers on what real successful companies are made of and what pitfalls to avoid along the way. Also, everyone in technology should read it to get a perspective on the evolution in the space of personal and consumer computing and to understand where we're headed and how to get there. Even if you're not an executive or a geek, you should read this book for its fascinating (and well told) story of a man from Northern California who dramatically changed how we live. A man as rich with creativity and intuition for what consumers want as he was bankrupt of decency and compassion for most of those he touched.It's a story worth reading. If for nothing else, read it to understand what it took to create the device on which you're reading this very review."

a fan of the book; not a fan of the man...",09/12/2011,"I'm not an Apple person. So if you're an Apple person, you can stop reading now, because you probably won't like this review. I have never liked Apple's closed-system philosophy, nor have I ever liked what I consider their over-priced and under-powered products. I have always liked the open-system philosophy of the IBM PC architecture (which is usually simplified to ""windows PC"", but people forget that many different operating systems can and do run on the IBM PC architecture). As far as Steve Jobs goes, until I read this book I never really knew that much about him, other than the usual stuff - co-founder of Apple, father of the MacIntosh, and really, really rich guy. Now that I do know more about him, I have to say, I don't like him.But I'm reviewing a book here, specifically a biography, and although it can be hard to separate one's opinion of the book from one's opinion of its subject, I'll try.Basically, I liked this book. I liked it a lot, actually. I imagine it must have been somewhat difficult for Isaacson - who had previously written biographies of Benjamin Franklin (
Benjamin Franklin: An American Life
) and Albert Einstein (
Einstein: His Life and Universe
) - to now write a biography of someone who was still alive. As a matter of fact, Jobs' death is not mentioned in the book. I know the publication of the book was hurried after his death, but I would have thought that at least the fact and date of his death would have been in the book. At any rate, if you segment Jobs' life (and the book) as Youth, Apple I, Not Apple, and Apple II, I found the most compelling parts to be in this order: Apple I, Youth, Not Apple, and Apple II. The last segment of the book - Apple II - I found to be rather dry, with a sort of hurried, factual quality to it (for example, subchapters were titled ""iPod"", ""iPhone"", ""Apps"", etc).  The final chapter is clearly different from the rest of the book, and it's easy to imagine that it was cobbled together very quickly on Jobs' death.However, the first three segments - especially the first two - I found thoroughly absorbing. I am about the same age as Jobs (and Gates), so I have lived in basically the same social environment, and I believe as far as that goes Isaacson has captured the times well. And, as far as I could, by checking other books (for example, the excellent history of the personal computer 
Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer (Second Edition)
) and online sources, I believe his facts are, for the most part, correct. As I read the book, I was consciously looking for evidence of a fawning, or excessively flattering treatment, but I never really found that to be the case. That did seem to occur more in the last few chapters, but most of the book seemed to be very objective, even critical. The author many times, for example, would interject in parentheses stating when he thought a quote by Jobs was an outright lie. The first half of the book clearly described Jobs' character and motivations much more than the second half. The second half of the book was more of a description of Jobs' career, but even so, most of it - until the last few chapters - was very well written and interesting. Let's face it - Jobs had an interesting life, and although the book is 571 pages of actual text, it will take several more books to describe each facet of his career in detail. One of the most interesting parts of the book, and a part of Jobs' career I knew very little about, was his involvement with Pixar/Disney. As a matter of fact, approximately three quarters of his wealth derives from that connection. He is the single largest stockholder in Disney - by far.I stated at the outset that I'm not an Apple fan, so what was my motivation to read it? Partly it was my interest in the history of the PC. As was Jobs and Gates, as a young man I also was drawn to the idea of a ""personal computer"". My first PC was an Atari 800, and I learned BASIC on it. I used to save programs on a cassette recorder. My second PC was an IBM PC/XT. It had a 5MB hard drive (yes - MB). It's not easy for anyone born after 1990 or so to appreciate the sense of wonder that surrounded the appearance of these machines. I sincerely believe that the drama that Jobs created with his product introductions to some extent stems from a desire to recapture that initial sense of wonder, that this is a machine that can be programmed to do anything you can think of. Another motivation for me was that, in interviews, I have heard the author put Jobs in the same class of great men such as Thomas Edison. Now, Edison is one of my heroes (one of Jobs' heroes as well), and I wanted to see for myself if that was justified (it was not).Great industrialists are very often (though not always) focused, intensely energetic, ego-driven, and cruel people. And Jobs was all of those. And I don't think I'm being mean here, that's all in the book. The author does not psychoanalyze Jobs, but he does share some opinions, both his own and those of others, as to what motivated him. That topic alone is probably good for another few books. In the end though, the conclusion I drew was that he was not a very nice person, either to know or to work for. Steve Wozniak, on the other hand, apparently was a very nice person, and Jobs seemed to be cordial to him more than anyone else in the book. As a matter of fact, one of the mysteries of the book - for me - is that it doesn't really go into that relationship much at all. It mentions Wozniak, but only because it has to, I mean, he invented the Apple computer! Outside of that, if all you knew about Wozniak was what you read in this book, you would think he was just an early business associate of Jobs.Steve Jobs was a visionary - no doubt about that. And he had an almost unerring sense of design. But was he a ""great man""? I guess it depends on what you consider a ""great man"". But before you decide that, here's another interesting point - Jobs only got Apple back on its feet after introducing the iPod (several versions of the mac went down in flames). For the last 4 years (at least) Apple has received 50% of its revenues from iPod/iPhone sales, and only 25% of its revenues from computers. And the iPhone % is continuing to increase. In other words, Apple today is really a music player/cell phone company. Of course, Apple invented neither, they just improved them. So Jobs is a great man if you define that to be a man who transformed Apple into a domestic version of Sony. Now, that's not an insignificant accomplishment. However, creating a more aesthetic mp3 player is not my definition of a great man. But then, I'm not an Apple person..."

Steve Jobs",19/08/2012,"I am not a fan of Apple. I have never bought any of their products, and I have never thought much about Steve Jobs even though I grew up a child of the 80's and 90's. I have always been a PC user and now use Android. I find it fascinating that Apple considered itself the ""good guys"" when comparing itself to Microsoft, IBM, and these days Google. While I do believe the quality of a product can be higher when you are controlling the end to end experience, I never agreed that they should be the ones deciding what you should do with the item you purchased. Apple tells you how you are going to use their product and you either take it or leave it. When Steve Jobs didn't like Adobe Flash, he didn't put it on Apple products. He made a choice that was yours to make, not his. Apple put out the iconic ""1984"" ad basically saying Apple was going against the establishment, but to me they were the ultimate example of control and that has made me uninterested in buying their products in the past.I still find myself fascinated by the life of Steve Jobs now that I'm a little older and that's what made me finally decide to purchase the book. Steve was a very unique individual, and that's both a good and bad thing. In some areas he was definitely a genius. I would also say he was eccentric and a narcissist. If you read about many very intelligent people throughout history there were often dark sides to them almost as if the unique aspects of their minds had to be balanced by issues in other areas. Some say Jobs was a functioning psychopath. I have no idea if I would go that far, but its obvious from reading the book that while he was very good at what he did, something was also kind of off. I cant logically make sense of an intelligent person like him falling for so much nonsense when it came to food and dieting like he did.The biggest issue is, not surprisingly, the way he treated people. Years ago I would have condemned Jobs, but my own experiences in life have caused me to have mixed opinions now. How successful would Apple have been if Jobs did not act the way he did? We can only guess, but I'd be willing to bet good money not as successful as it turned out to be. I had the displeasure of working for an executive that was truly ignorant and arrogant towards the people below him. I left the company because I would not treat my people that way and do not agree with it, but I also believe that you cant always be the nice guy if you want to truly be successful. Yes, I do believe Steve Jobs went over the edge with this at times, and I could never be like him, but accountability is important, and when you are just the nice guy people take advantage of you or don't take situations as seriously as they should. Steve didn't accept less than the best and he was very brutally honest about it with the people around him. These days I feel like there is a little bit of Steve's style in the way I do things and that is ok. There needs to be balance in all things, but for Steve everything was very black and white and that pushed him to extremes most people would not feel comfortable using in their own lives.I have read many of the one and two star reviews and find myself disagreeing with some of the points made in those reviews. I don't see the book as being all negative and avoiding the good things about Steve's life. It just stated things as they were. Intelligent people can put the pieces together and each of us has to come to our own conclusions after reading the book. He accomplished some amazing things in his life and he seemed to truly enjoy what he did. On the other hand, most of his life he was not a great family man, and he was not that great to the people around him which has brought out some extreme opinions from those who worked with him. I didn't read the book and think wow this guy was a horrible person. I actually have a better opinion of Steve and Apple after reading the book. I may even buy one of their products after reading the book. He was an imperfect person in many ways, but he also accomplished things that most of us can only ever dream of. I now wish I had the opportunity to spend time with him and really see what he was like and learn from him.I did find a few things about the book a little weak. Like some other reviewers, I do think the book should have gone chronologically more and bounced around less. It just seemed to skip over some things or barely mention them and a couple of times a first name would be mentioned and I wasn't sure who it was and found myself going backwards trying to figure out if the person was mentioned before. I also agree that the style of the book changed when I made it to the last 20% or so, as if they were in a rush to release the book after his death. I would like to have seen more thoughts from Jobs near the end and more from his family, though I do agree with how the book ended. At first it seemed kind of odd and I expected more, but ending it at the point Isaacson last visited with Jobs was actually the most respectful ending he could have given.Overall the book is very good and will leave you deep in contemplation once you are done as to what kind of person Steve Jobs really was. The good and the bad. The extremes in his life and how he dealt with people in general. Again, I finished the book and came away with a greater respect for Steve Jobs, and I think if you can read between the lines a bit and really spend some time thinking about what you read, you will also come away having some different thoughts regardless of whether you like or dislike Jobs or Apple. The book may not be perfect, and we are only spectators who were not a part of Jobs life, but the book accomplished what it needed to, and the overall experience combined both sides of Jobs into something dignified. That's all it needed to do."

Driven by Perfection",27/11/2011,"My thoughts - a powerful, yet not entirely flattering biography, of a charismatic, temperamental, narcissistic genius who was driven by perfectionism. (You may wish to skim this review if you plan on reading this book).Steve Jobs, a man who will not be easily forgotten, passed away on October 5, 2011 at the age of 56.  In 2009, knowing he was dying, he got Walter Isaacson to agree to write a book about his life. Over the course of the next two difficult years of Job's illness, Isaacson conducted over 40 interviews with him, his friends, family and former coworkers.Jobs grew up in Mountainview, CA, outside of Palo Alto, the adopted son of Paul and Clara Jobs. His biological parents --grad students, a Syrian father and American mother,  he referred to as his ""sperm and egg bank"". Even when he later found out who his real parents were, he always referred to his adoptive parents as his ""real"" parents. However, it appears apparent from reading this book, that being abandoned by his biological parents was a real issue for Job's throughout his life, and it affected the way he treated people as an adult.As a young boy, early on Job's realized he was brighter than his parents. This made him feel more detached. In fact in the 4th grade he tested at a 10th grade level.  Bored with school, he was also somewhat socially awkward and was often bullied at school.  He demanded that he be sent to another school or that he would stop going to school, so his parents moved to a better neighborhood. It was here where Jobs began tinkering with electronics in his garage. This is where is all begin in 1976 for Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak. The two were both loners and ""music geeks"" introduced by a friend. Jobs experimented with pot, hash, and LSD and embraced the hippie lifestyle.  The only college that Jobs had any interest in attending was Reed College in Portland, Oregon. It was at Reed that Jobs became interested in Buddhism, attended a Hare Krishna Temple,and became obsessive about dieting and vegetarianism. He was on a personal unending search for enlightenment, which he never quite seemed to find. Jobs dropped out of Reed College to travel around India on a spiritual journey.Job's biography covers his 30+ year career which includes not only the start up operation of Apple Computer out his garage, but also his involvement at Atari, Pixar and NeXT. Just four years after Apple's start up, the company went public and was worth 1.79 billion dollars. By the age of 25 Jobs was worth 256 million dollars and made 300 other people millionaires in the process.  In 2011 Apple is a 40 billion dollar Company. Yet despite his wealth Jobs was a minimalist, believing that in home and in business, ""simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"".Job's opinion of himself was that ""he was special"". He had the uncanny ability to read people and to know exactly what their weak points were.  He used that to his advantage, and created a fear factor in those who worked for him. He was eager to put people down, often in front of others, and wasn't afraid to tell those who worked for him that their ideas were dumb. His prickly behavior caused a high burnout in staff, and because of his high expectations his goal in hiring was to find creative, super-smart people who had a rebellious spirit.He was a genius in business,  but not so much in his personal life. His biography covers his tumultuous relationship with daughter Lisa who he fathered out of wedlock in 1978, to his marriage in 1991 to Laureen Powell and the birth of his first child that same year, who for the first two weeks of his life was known simply as ""baby boy Jobs"".  In 1995 and 1998 two more children, daughters were born to Steve and Laureen.  His was described as aloof to his daughters and often ""prickly"" to his wife, thus by no means an easy man to live with.His illness,was first diagnosed in October of 2003, with what was believed to be, a curable form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs decided against surgery despite the urging of his doctors and those closest to him. Instead he chose to try some radical diets and fastings in the hope they would cleanse his body of cancer. His was obsessed with body image and did not want to have a surgery he believed might not be entirely necessary. The nine month wait caused his cancer to spread, and his health and quality of life would deteriorate as well, ending with his death on October 5, 2011.Steve Jobs is a fascinating read about a complicated and extremely fascinating man. As prickly as this man could be at times, there are a few paragraphs that were able to bring me to tears.  Apparently, according to Jobs, much of your thinking is changed in the face of death, and suddenly you no longer worry about ""having something to lose.""A highly recommended read."

A magnificent job on Jobs",18/11/2011,"On a scale of 1 to 5, this biography is a 10. I am not usually much for reading biographies, but this one is compelling, even exciting. As I write this review, it has been only 45 days since Steve Jobs died. Thus, I find it amazing that I am just finishing Walter Isaacson's masterful piece of work about the life of one of my heroes. It has been on the stands for less than a month and already it is on Amazon's list of the year's 100 best books. So, why my interest? Part of it is due to my status as a ""Mac person."" I have worked on Apple computers since the days of Apple IIe, when one of these machines was all that was available in the department (i.e., the biology department of Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus). Somehow, a bit later I scored a school-owned Mac SE, with its tiny 9-inch monochromatic screen. That computer, however, did not survive the trashing of our home by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. I then decided it was time to buy my own, so I went through the underwhelming Performa 6400 and, when it died, moved to the Power Mac G4 (still working), and finally to the MacBook Pro laptop, on which I am creating this review. Steve Jobs was the person, more than anyone else, responsible for putting these devices in my hands. I am happy now to have Isaacson's recounting of the four phases of Jobs' life: pre-Apple (his early life), Apple 1 (prior to his ouster), NeXT/Pixar (prior to his return), and Apple 2 (after his return). The author conducted many, many interviews with people who knew Steve (including some who loved him and some who didn't). Steve gave Isaacson carte blanche in painting an accurate picture of this complex man, who, it is fair to say, would not have been easy to like, especially if one was an employee (or a wife, child, or competitor). Nonetheless, Jobs was responsible for creating the Apple culture by his end-to-end strategy involving the marriage of computer hardware and software and that of technology and the humanities, which has characterized the Apple approach to the present, except for the regrettable period between Apple 1 and Apple 2 when John Sculley and Gil Amelio ruled the roost. Does anyone still have a functioning Power Computing Mac clone? Probably not. That company, although successful, only had a two-year run (1995-1997), because Steve killed the Mac cloning business when he returned to Apple as interim CEO. Another major breakthrough for Apple and Steve came with the concept of the ""digital hub,"" i.e., the coordination of a range of devices to play music, record video, and take photographs. In a sense, the digital hub concept was an extension of the end-to-end strategy, and led, in succession, to the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. It also gave rise to the Apple and iTunes stores. For many people, any one of these accomplishments, the desktop computer, the laptop computer, the music player, the phone, the tablet computer, would have sufficed to define one's impact on the world, but Steve Jobs was not interested simply in impacting the world; he wished to ""make a dent in the universe."" One of the really interesting aspects of Steve's makeup discussed by Isaacson is the major contrast between the thinking prowess of this man as related to techno-domination and the cracked approach to his personal life, especially his health. I think that the author makes the case that both his ability to make technological magic and his willingness to ignore the unavoidable resulted from his practice of the so-called ""reality distortion field."" Jobs believed that he could remake the rules by which the universe operates. In business, this might mean that he could push people to perform beyond their understanding of their own capacities so as to meet ostensibly unachievable deadlines. In his personal life, reality distortion could allow for the ignoring of medical advice about the neuroendrocrine pancreatic cancer that killed him. While some might regret his decisions that seem to have hastened his death, we need to remember that it is much more common for humans to live in a reality distrotion field than it is for them to own up to reality and get on with their lives in the real world. When Steve Jobs died on October 5th of this year, the company he began released a statement acknowledging that ""Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives."" This has certainly been the case for me and I am indebted substantially to Walter Isaacson for his look at Steve's life, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in how this man dented the universe. Now, since Apple has a new board chairman, it remains to be seen what the answers will be to two key questions. Will Apple retain its innovative edge under new leadership and will the new leadership be able to create a proper tribute to Steve Jobs' greatness?"

Marketing & Management Lessons from ""Steve Jobs"" Biography-""This was a man!""",18/11/2011,"Steve Jobs' life could well be summed up in a famous claim attributed to Julius Caesar, ""I came, I saw, I conquered."" Because, in reading Isaacson's book, one gets the impression that Steve Jobs in his relatively short life seemed to be in a rush to ""change the world."" By mastering the art of marrying creativity and engineering, he adapted cutting-edge technologies to simplify life for mankind. In doing so, as Isaacson points out, Steve Jobs transformed (conquered, if you will) six major industries:1. Personal computers2. Animated movies3. Music4. Phones5. Tablet computing6. Digital publishingWhile the impact of these transformations were significantly greater in the B2C world of movies, music and phones; he also created enormous trend-setting influences in the B2B domain of computers and digital publishing.In keeping with the Julius Caesar metaphors, I am reminded of another great quote from Shakespeare's play on the life of the Roman emperor, in which Mark Antony grieves after Caesar has been slain, ""The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones."" In reading Isaacson's book, I got the impression that the reverse of this quote was true in the case of Steve Jobs - some of the ""evil"" personality traits that Steve displayed during his short life will soon be forgotten, but the tremendous good that his professional endeavors bestowed upon the world will live on forever.Isaacson made much about Steve Jobs and his ""Reality Distortion Field (RDF)."" Every time I came across this nebulous concept in the book, I couldn't help think that by definition ""reality distortion"" is an oxymoron. RDF is a mind-bending exercise that is typically associated with people who experiment with hallucinogens and/or practice intensive meditative techniques. Steve indulged in both of these activities and this probably convinced him that he had the will power to make subordinates and colleagues achieve the impossible. But as the old saying goes, ""it takes two to tango,"" and Steve couldn't have been a leader of the RDF cult, if he did not have willing followers. The bottom line is Steve used RDF for the public good - he led them to create insanely good products and did not get them to just drink the Kool-Aid. In any event, this is not a management style that I would recommend because it is not one that can be taught - some chosen few are born with it and Steve Jobs was one of them.From a marketing standpoint, if there is a single most appealing characteristic of Steve Jobs that stands out in Isaacson's book, it is the one that gave him an ability to so seamlessly intersect art and engineering in a superior fashion, which can be seen in every product from the first Macintosh to the last iPad. Steve's mind naturally converged its logical left brain and creative right brain activities and thus enabled him to gracefully connect the complex with the simple. More importantly, he imbued his ""think different"" philosophy into every product using the KISS - ""Keep it Small & Simple"" - standard that required every user experience to be as intuitive and simple as possible, even when it meant integrating very sophisticated hardware and software to make it happen.The flip side of Steve's KISS was an insistence on providing a tightly-controlled, end-to-end user experience, which required him to manage a very vertically-integrated company. In the age of the internet and open systems, this was a rather contrarian approach. But, as Isaacson points out with several instances in the book, Steve did display some very contradictory traits-both, on the personal side and in his professional behavior. Nonetheless, these contradictions did not prevent him from achieving what he set out to do. Again, this is a characteristic that cannot be acquired and probably not a management style that ordinary people would be able to pull off. But Steve did!Steve was not only opposed to a horizontally-fragmented, decentralized company structure, but also adopted a very collaborative management style to boot-it involved all functional departments at all stages of the concept-to-launch cycle. This operating style enabled him to tinker, change and even scrap late-stage designs and start over, if the perfectionist in him was not satisfied with the way a product/service was turning out. Steve defied conventional product marketing methods and, in fact, did not believe in traditional market research. Again, this methodology had a better chance of succeeding in the ""build it and they will come"" naivete of the B2C world, but would be more difficult to pull off in the stricter demands of the B2B world. It probably explains why Steve was wildly successful in the B2C industries and to a lesser degree in the B2B sectors.To read the complete review, check my blog, ""The Marketing Id."""

A challenging life",17/12/2012,"I had heard many stories and read much about Steve Jobs and the thought of reading a biography which he himself had ""authorized"" was an interesting prospect. Friends of mine also knew him very well and he would be at their house every week for something to eat and the opportunity to talk. He was, it seems, for all his other foibles, a very good friend (at least for friends outside of the business he was in) keeping this part of his life free of the angst, chaos, confusion and anger he could introduce into the lives of his colleagues. He also enjoyed eating with my friends, giving another take on his nutritional beliefs, complexities and hangups which feature greatly in the book.Within a comparatively few pages also, I had a case of ""déjà vu"": my first major job in the corporate world in Australia, introduced me to a boss whose similarities with Steve Jobs were virtually a mirror-image. He was driven, enthusiastic, passionate about things and projects; totally self-centered; at times, totally insufferable; paranoid; mercurial - in fact, the list of similar ""negatives"" went on ad infinitum. He could swear one moment that white was white, then it was black, then grey, the purple, then, having confused and upset many, admit he was wrong and that white was indeed white; he loved ideas - often triggered by something seen or heard - and thought them up, conjured them up and re-engineered them continually, thinking nothing of an excited telephone call at late or early hours most would describe as ""ill-considered timing"" because they would in all probability be asleep. He was a hard task master but also, by endless example, one learned much about how to do things best and equally how not to do things. It was a master-servant relationship but, he appreciated talent and creativity and nurtured it because the talent of others helped create the vision he had of product and service perfection as well as adding those missing dimensions he himself required for a more complete picture. He was like a conductor of capabilities; a chef bringing it all into an exciting new recipe to which others became addicted.Our working relationship survived 11 years and, like those who worked with Jobs, one learned not to be offended at stolen ideas. Whatever went into his head and re-emerged WAS his idea although at times when one least expected it, a public compliment would be given. So, as with those colleagues sharing ""Life with Steve"", for me, it was an exciting and often unpredictable roller-coaster ride and certainly no tranquil, boring backwater. Like Jobs, my former boss believed in creating the future and that people didn't really know what they wanted or preferred until you gave it to them. Thus, asking their opinions before the event was a pointless exercise. Marketing the message and the product was far more important and these had first to be created!So, the book for me was an unfurling of much about a person driven and impassioned but who also, I think, believed in karma. I provides cause for reflection, given the ultimate outcomes of his life. One develops a certain sympathy for those who were chewed up and spat out during the entire process. Jobs could be dictatorial, brutal, vicious and ruthless as well as totally unpredictable. His views on design and production often meant huge costs, particularly (and as often happened) he changed his mind. But, the book also provides a journey of discovery as the Jobs vision for computers and revolutionary consumer electronics and his battles with other competing companies, take center-stage. Over time also, especially as Jobs starts to mellow and with the onset of his cancer, the obnoxious, hard-nosed, apparently immune-from-all-evil attitude starts to show a more human face. For all the bravado too, and, remembering that in spite of all he was a multi-millionaire in his early twenties, when he was ousted from Apple and had a time in the wilderness with NEXT and other ventures, over time he began to learn from his mistakes. Being an ideas man and visionary is all very well but, one also needs practical and technical heads to make it all happen. So, by the time Apple had become a basket case on the verge of insolvency, he alone had the capacity to rescue it. This, he did, a most remarkable turnaround, to create the world's most valued brand. The impacts of his vision affected computers to be sure but more importantly, mobile telephone technology; film, music and  videos and how they are marketed as well as enjoyed on mobile devices; communications and also of course, flagship marketing in signature stores which are at once a design statement as well as a total experience. Every Apple store I have ever been into all over the world has been almost standing room only. There is thus a total mystique but also a reality, an experience.The book sees a much softer and more attractive Jobs emerge towards the end, in spite of some technical problems with the iPhone 4 and one sees a more subdued Jobs on a gradual and not-too-pleasant pathway into the valley of death. Somewhat oddly, however, the book ends in denial of his death, at least denial by omission. It is almost as is there is an anticipated second coming. Once Jobs gets heaven and hell sorted out he will come back to earth."

Great Biography",31/05/2023,"I loved this book.  I was never interested in Apple products.  I had several college friends that became school teachers and Apple was all they could talk about.  For some reason, that turned me off.  I have found out recently that I was not alone in this assessment.  I bought my first “IBM Compatible” computer around 1985.  Over the years I had several Dell computers using Windows and Microsoft Word, Excel, Access Database, Quicken, etc.  I also used this type of hardware and software at work.  I had an Android phone which I hated.  In 2008 I discovered the iPod.  OMG, loved it.  In 2019 my iPod was dead, my Canon camera was awful and I hated the Android phone.  I walked in to AT&T and walked out with the iPhone XR which blew me away.  Three devices in one.  Great music, a great phone and a camera.  In 2021 I had a Samsung Tablet that started to act up.  I went for the iPad Mini.  No comparison to Samsung.  In 2022, my Dell desktop was 5 years old.  I decided to make a huge leap and go for an iMac.  The transition from Windows and Microsoft to Apple wasn’t exactly a piece of cake but, thanks to hours of YouTube Videos, I made it.  I’m never going back.  Three devices that all sync with each other.  Documents in iCloud.  If you’re an Apple user, you know what I mean.  If you’re not an Apple user, you don’t know what you’re missing.  So, back to this book review:  it was fascinating to read about the development of all of these devices.  I knew a little about Steve Jobs, but this book really goes in to the detail about his life and this company.  He was a very complicated genius.  He truly did change the world and Walter Isaacson did a fabulous job telling his complicated story."

A Passion for the Perfect Product",26/11/2011,"There was a lot to Steve Jobs, despite his penchant for minimalism.  But what stands out the most to me from Isaacon's biography is Jobs' passion for making great products -- his uncompromising obsession with making everything that he touched as perfect as it could be.  That's what Jobs' legacy is for the great majority of us who didn't work with or live close to him -- he not only gave us incredible, ground-breaking products, but a model of personal passion to produce the thing that is perfect.Isaacson presents more than that one side of Jobs.  There is also Jobs the interpersonal disaster, the narcissist seemingly utterly lacking the capacity for empathy.  As Isaacson says and cites others saying, Jobs seems to actually need to tear down other people now and then, and shows little regret afterwards.  This often-public destruction of another human being can be rationalized as the need to push people to extreme accomplishments, or to separate ""B players"" from ""A players"", but it is all too-often abused as an excuse for simply being a jerk.Another side that Isaacson reveals is Jobs as complex husband and father.  Given how difficult his relationships with people in general were, it's not hard to imagine that his romantic relationships were difficult as well, or that he struggled as a parent, particularly with his daughters.  His initial denial of his first child, by his girlfriend at the time, is appalling but really not so surprising, given all that we learn about his apparent drive to unfettered self-indulgence.But all of that, as reprehensible as it is, pales in comparison to what I took away from Isaacson's book about Jobs the designer.The ""product"" is more than the thing, for Jobs.  It begins with the advertising, the shopping experience at the Apple store, the paying experience, the packaging, then the thing itself, how you use it, how you use it with other products, the support experience, even how you eventually replace the product with something new -- Jobs wanted every bit of it to be perfect. Hence the closed system that Apple both suffers and thrives from.  In an almost measured, wise moment, Jobs grants to Bill Gates that each pursued a profitable course, one controlling the product and the other freely licensing it for wide adoption and multiple sources of innovation.  Of course, when he comes back to himself, Jobs believes and says that what Microsoft produced, by allowing any and all to play in an uncoordinated manner, was ""crap.""  Openness sounds good and plays well in the technology culture, but Jobs' particular path to perfection demanded and thrived on control.What's odd is that, as a person of so little empathy, Jobs could be such a great, almost unerring, judge of what people would love in a product.  After all, ""perfection"" here is hardly an objective standard -- it's Jobs' own judgment.  He was wrong now and then -- the G4 Cube or that hockey puck mouse that came with the original iMac -- but his batting average was awfully good.  Isaacson provides a jaw-dropping list, from the Apple II and the Mac, through Toy Story, iTunes, the iPhone and iPod, the iPad, the Apple retail stores, and right up to iCloud.  And he did it all while disdaining customer focus groups or even customer testing.  ""Our job,"" he said, ""is to figure out what they're going to want before they do.""Jobs' passion went beyond the product, too, to the company itself.  It's clear, especially later in his life, that Apple was not just a vehicle for him, that he wanted to create a great company that would continue well beyond his leadership, to go on to create great, innovative products, with that same no-compromise approach.  He may not have been a great teacher or mentor, and we'll see how that part of his legacy turns out, but the intention to create a great company that outlived him was certainly there.Jobs has sometimes been derided as simply a skilled marketer (by distinction from Steve Wozniak's technical brilliance), even as a con man, manipulating whole crowds by creating  ""reality distortion fields"" around him.  But I think Jobs was sincere. Even when he shilled his products, proclaiming them ""the greatest thing we've done"", he meant it.  Why not?  He had made sure it was great, he wouldn't stop until it was.  When he told the Cupertino City Council, while showing the drawings for Apple's proposed new headquarters, ""It's like a spaceship has landed,"" he wasn't so much hyping as he was showing his own genuine delight with what he and his architects were creating.  That delight was the payoff for his perfectionism.Isaacson's book won't be the only biography of Jobs.  I'd be interested to read, for example, a study of Jobs as designer (or of Apple's design history under his leadership, finally giving due respect to the contributions of not only Jony Ive but the many others who contributed).  But Isaacson's is certainly a good starting point, a kind of opening to the conversation that others can now take up and hopefully will."

A damned good read....",02/01/2012,"First and foremost, this is just a good read.I found that Isaacson's bio of Einstein was both interesting and did a profoundly better job of explaining relativity than my physics professors ever did.  This book didn't disappoint.  It was both captivating, and offered meaningful insight into Steve Jobs and the history of Apple.On way of my own biases, I was an Apple bigot before being an Apple bigot was cool.  I learned to program on an Apple II that my father brought home in 1980.  I've been a shareholder since I was given a single share of Apple stock for my bar mitzvah in 1981.  I later grew up using Macs in college for everything from writing papers to digital circuit simulation to writing shareware apps that paid off debt I had accumulated as a starving grad student and provided the down payment on my first home.  I even continued to use a Mac (eventually a PowerPC clone) as my exclusive home computer during most of my tenure with IBM!But around 1998-99, I finally gave up on Macs and bought my first PC.  By then I had concluded that Windows hadn't simply caught up, but in many regards had surpassed the Mac.  Mac had become a lesser computer that cost a premium, for which applications were fewer in number, and cost more.  Even after Apple finally made substantial improvements and moved to a Unix kernel, I've never been tempted to look back.What's more, as Apple entered the consumer electronics domain and began producing closed devices and systems characterized by excessive proprietary control, I developed a decidedly anti-Apple viewpoint.  Not a reflexive anti-Apple bias -- I did eventually start using a hand-me-down iPod when my daughter just had to upgrade to a iTouch.  And we eventually all got iPhones after I concluded that, whatever it's limitations, it was still a better option than the available Android alternatives.  But you get the point -- I'm now closer to being an anti-Apple bigot than one of the hordes of Apple fans.This book provides real insight into why Apple systems are as closed as they are, and why Apple acts as controlling as it does.  It provides a good understanding of just how Steve Jobs drove Apple to where it is today.Ultimately, the book does not paint a flattering picture of Jobs.  I've read other reviewers who complained that Isaacson clearly disliked Jobs, and that the book was a hatchet job.  I've seen Isaacson doing interviews since Jobs' death, however, and if anything, I'd say the opposite is true.  I think he actually holds Jobs in awe.(Those who find the description of Jobs as such an unrelenting jerk incompatible with the extremely strong positive feelings expressed by many who worked with him have clearly never worked with somebody of his ilk, and fail to recognize something basic in human psychology.  When people go through what is effectively prolonged hazing, one of two things happen: either they part ways prior to completion, in which cases they are left only with enormous resentment over the hazing/bad behavior, or they survive the hazing and feel empowered and strongly bound to the others involved, as a result.  What you would expect from those who worked closely with/for Jobs is precisely a polarized love or hate reaction.  But even those who come out with strong positive feelings will still very much recognize, and likely even resent, the bad behavior.)I've also seen complaints that the book gives short shrift to specific events or aspects of Jobs' life.  That strikes me as inevitable.  The book is ~600 pages as it is.  I think the purpose of the book is to provide meaningful insight into Jobs, including what formed him and what he formed, not to comprehensively document each and every aspect and occurrence of his life.Are there places where the book is lacking?  Yes, I think so.  The book suggests that there was a substantial change in Jobs -- a maturation -- between his initial stint with Apple and his second run there.  But if he became more reasonable and effective at his interpersonal interactions with Apple employees in his second stint, that certainly wasn't apparent to me from the book.In any case, whatever its limitations, and whatever your feelings toward Apple or Steve Jobs, this book is enlightening and entertaining, and well worth the read.P.S. For the record, this is the first book I've read in it's entirety on an eReader.  (A Kindle Fire -- perhaps there's some irony there.)"

Masterful look into the life of an imperfect and flawed genius",12/02/2012,"I would not have been considered as part of the `target market' for Walter Isaacson's new biography of Steve Jobs. I knew very little about Jobs. I am at best a point and click MicroSoft computer user and really only have a vague idea of what an operating system is.I began reading this book because over the last 4 years, I have been told I look like Steve Jobs, maybe a hundred times. I was actually pulled out of line by the TSA last year at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and brought through a special line. I thought I was going to be searched but as I was walking through, the TSA agent said, ""I am praying for you, Mr. Jobs."" I laughed and told him I appreciate the prayers but I was not Mr. Jobs. He then asked to see my license. He didn't believe me.I have worn black turtlenecks for years. I didn't know Jobs wore them. I hate to shave, so usually have a face full of stubble. I only pull out a razor when I am speaking (I am an author and professional speaker) or have a ""suit and tie"" business meeting. I began wearing glasses full-time in 2008 and the mistaken identity began almost immediately. My only other connection to the man is that I love my iPhone.The publicity surrounding his death increased the ""do you know who you look like?"" questions by ten times. During a recent walk through Midway Airport in Chicago, the young lady at the ticket counter said, ""I know everyone must tell you that you look like Steve jobs, right?"" As I walked to security, the TSA agent looked at me and asked if I was a celebrity impersonator. I said ""No, but I do get mistaken for John Wayne often."" Then, as I loaded into the Southwest flight, one of the flight attendants was looking at me and walked up with her copy of the book and held it up to my face and asked, ""Are you trying to look like him?"" I assured her I was not. I then told her that I bet Steve was often mistaken for me. She looked at me and responded, ""Nah.""So when I landed in Dallas, I downloaded this book on my new Kindle and the unexpected happened - I was mesmerized. People will say in reviews, as a standard line, ""I could not put this book down."" We all know they certainly were able to put it down ... but never in my life have I been so captivated by a book.Walter Isaacson has performed an incredible service in his skillfully writtten examination of a life. It is structured perfectly, flows beautifully and is a brutally honest look at a brilliant man who will become a colorful part of our cultural history. Through most of this story, I did not like Steve Jobs but tolerated his arrogance and rudeness as part of what makes this story great.  Then came the point in the book where I realized it is not arrogance if it is true and I believe Steve Jobs to be a genius.I feel sorry for those who loved and respected him but suffered his wrath and continued to do so because of their loyalty to him and the ""Apple Idea."" I despise him for the rejection and denial of his first daughter and know she will suffer for the rest of her life because of both his actions and inactions. I feel sorry for him because of the joy his daughter could have brought to his earlier life, that he chose to miss. Yes, he tried to make up for it later, but I think those are the kinds of losses that can never be regained.As the book progressed, I still did not like him, but the tremendous respect I felt for his accomplishments and intellect blossomed. Steve Jobs is the most interesting human being I have ever encountered, even though my only introductions are through this book ... and being occasionally misidentified as him. However, Walter Isaacson's skillful masterpiece is more than enough. Through Isaacson's insightful eyes and his carefully chosen and crafted words, I feel I have personally met a man that will be remembered as an American icon and revered for generations to come. Through this book, I witnessed a combination of his genius and severe personality defects in a way that displayed, what I believe is, a complete picture of Steve Jobs.When I began reading this book, the LAST thing I ever expected to say was this ...""This is the best book I have ever read. Period.""Go figure ... I would have never guessed."

Story of the man who put a dent in the universe. Well worth reading.",25/10/2011,"Steve Jobs wanted to change the world, ""put a dent in the universe."" And he did.  If you are interested in life and want to know how Jobs changed it right before our eyes, you should read this book.No other book on Jobs has been based on first hand information from the Master himself, his colleagues and his detractors. There is no other way to know the man who changed the way we live and work. The fact that the book is engaging is a big bonus.First Jobs' personal life, personality and beliefs. Like all fascinating people in history, Jobs was a bundle of contradictions. Born out of wedlock, he was an American icon and yet born of a Syrian Muslim whom he never knew, but had accidentally met. Adopted at birth by working class parents, he became skeptical of the Church as the all-knowing god did not help the starving children in Biafra and alternated between being a believer and a non-believer. He was, at different times, a vegan and a fruitarian (hence the name Apple).  Jobs was influenced by the counter cultural ideas of the 60's and the 70's and yet become one of the most revered corporate figures of all time. He was a multi-billionaire who lived on a regular street with no high fenced compound, security or live-in servants; a Zen Buddhist who was obsessed with Zen-like simplicity but did not possess Zen-like tranquility; a son who tried to abandon his child like the way he had thought he was abandoned; a leader who was highly demanding of his colleagues and coworkers; a vastly influential figure in computing who neither built computers not wrote codes himself; a genius who was mean to many people. All these factoids had to have some influence on who he was and who he became and may keep interested psychologists busy for years. Yet, it is not for these tabloid fodder that he is looked upon with awe. To get caught up in the contradictions of a man is to miss the man.So who is the man then? Isaacson presents Jobs life and work as a play in three acts.During the first act, two unlikely partners named Steves (Jobs and Woz) create the world's first commercially viable personal computer, Apple II. Jobs then creates the revolutionary but unsuccessful Lisa. Apple goes public, Jobs creates the Mac, which carves itself a distinct niche. He then brings in Pepsi's Scully to manage the company only to find himself ousted from the company he founded. During his exile Jobs creates another revolutionary but not-so-successful computer NeXT.  But Jobs other venture, Pixar, an outstanding animation company, is a huge commercial success.The second act is Jobs' return to Apple.  Apple was in decline and it buys the money losing NeXT. Job returns to the company he founded as the interim CEO. Introduces a series of products: peppermint colored iMacs followed b y 21st Century Macs.The third act is the post-pc revolution, the most dramatic of all: the creation of ipod (almost 10 years ago to the day), paradigm-changing iphone and the category-creating ipad, along with many other things and cloud computing. We can't imagine a world today without ipads, ipods and iphones. The rewards are high. Apple first surpasses Microsoft and becomes the most valuable tech company. Then Apple becomes, for brief periods of time, the most valuable company in the world.But this is not the story of Apple, but of Job. What was happening in the background while the three act play is being staged -  to his family, his health, his odd beliefs that might have cost him his life, and his relationships with other giants of technology - is the focus of this book. The story is told with many interesting anecdotes such as Bill Gates incredulously exclaiming ""Do ALL of you live here?"" when visiting for the first time Steve Jobs' modest house.This is an ""authorized  biography"" and I'm wary of ""authorized"" biographies. Always thought they were full-length PR pieces. This one is different. Jobs gave Isaacson complete freedom to write the book and Jobs didn't demand editorial control. He didn't even want to see the book before it was published. And it shows. You see Jobs as he was. Warts and all. This is Jobs' last gift to those of us who admired his vision of the world, but wondered about the essence of the man behind it all. Now we know.As you finish reading Job's biography of nearly 600 pages, something strikes you as odd. Steve Jobs' death is not mentioned in the book. Not the date, not the time and not even the fact that he is no more. Strangely fascinating. Like the man himself."

A Superb Biography Of A Dysfunctional Genius",22/03/2012,"I am not sure that anyone from my generation is a proper person to review or really appreciate a biography of Steve Jobs. Mine was the generation where mother made toast in the oven; many a telephone call was made on a phone on which you called ""Central"" and were connected; news came either from the newspaper delivered to the door morning and evening or from the Saturday Evening Post or maybe Colliers Magazine, nothing more; and I can't remember anyone who had a radio. Over the years, of course, that has changed and those of us who are left from the generation to which I refer have become accustomed to most but certainly not all of the gadgets of modern technology. Yes, some can use computers and maybe even a cell phone, but the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad are still in the iCloud for most of us; and those are the instruments that Jobs essentially created and gave to us. If we use them at all we don't use them with the effortless ease, the spontaneity, or the cheerful aplomb of our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. So I have read this biography with a certain caution, not sure that I have fully appreciated the immense changes the man has brought to our society, not sure, for instance, that I completely understand the significance between an open and closed platform or grasp the elegance of the design of the iPad, and not sure that I can fairly evaluate the man and his work. One thing I am sure of, however, is that the black nature of the man makes a fair judgment of his work difficult and that, important as he was, there were others too  - mentioned but not honored in the book - who were equally important , equally talented and equally entitled to share the technology stage with him. This being said, however, I have no problem with appreciating good writing and the exercise of superlative literary and personal judgment on the part the author of this biography, a book which presents an accurate word picture, warts and all, of a major figure, an innovator, a mover and shaker of twenty first century technology, someone who ""knew what the public wanted before it knew what it wanted"". Even before he began this project, Walter Isaacson had been a solid biographer of Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger, Albert Einstein and others, working mostly if not completely from secondary sources. Here, however, in his Jobs biography he has worked primarily from original sources. He talked to Jobs - more than forty interviews or conversations. He talked to his former colleagues, his friends and his enemies, the Jobs family near and far, his business associates. In short as a skilled reporter, a former editor of Time and President of CNN he was no lightweight interviewer. Nor, because of his journalistic experience was he any lightweight when it came to putting it all together in an intelligent, readable and accurate story of a man who was his own worst enemy and who has helped define our present by his genius. Speaking of genius: When the seeds of genius are sprinkled among the human race at birth one hopes that the human vessel which receives them is normal - think Leonardo Da Vinci, J.S. Bach. Wm. Shakespeare, among others - but sometimes the vessel is flawed; and the vessel that was Steve Jobs was flawed beyond any conventional ability to forgive. He was eccentric and narcissistic to the line beyond which lies madness. He was unforgiving, cruel, selfish, unsympathetic, and disloyal to friends and associates. Only to his wife and children, to his adoptive parents and his sister Mona did he exhibit any sign of love or affection. He had no sense of humor, no humility, no gentility and no love for his fellow man or for his life or for that of others. In short, as a person he was simply terrible. And I doubt he ever experienced happiness - even for a moment. Triumph? Maybe. But Solace? Love? Tenderness? Peace? Never! I cannot imagine a sadder life. Yet his genius, his insights, his instincts and his uncontrollable work ethic gave us the best tools - the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad - with which to navigate and to find our way in the huge fathomless sea of data and information , the sea of music, art, literature and experience which lies by our bedside and at our doorstep.. So when you read these 600 pages  - and I hope you do - forget the warts on the man, enjoy the story and the way it has been told by a brilliant writer and be aware that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to read the life story of one of the most brilliant, beguiling, eccentric and important innovators of our time written by one of our very best biographers."

Well worth reading",28/11/2011,"The hottest book this fall is Walter Isaacon's biography of Steve Jobs, entitled Steve Jobs.  It has been at the top of the best seller list since Jobs' untimely death in October 2011.  For anyone interested in technology, product development, business, the seismic changes in the music or movie industries or entrepreneurship generally, this is a must read.The basic contours of Jobs' story are well known.  Steve Jobs, the college-dropout, hippie, Zen-oriented, whiz kid, created the personal computer with his friend in his parent's garage.  The computer, the Apple, becomes a runaway hit, evolved into the Macintosh (and the mouse and user interface that most of us currently use), and created an entire industry.  On the heels of his success, Jobs was fired by the company he created.  He created a new computer company, Next, which flopped.  After finding some humility, Jobs found his way back into Apple, reinvigorated the company, learned from his mistakes and then revolutionized the PC industry, the animation/movie industry (by creating Pixar, which made megahits such as Cars, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story etc.), the mobile phone industry (the iPhone) and mass-marketed touch computing.  He then created the tablet category of computers with the runaway hit, the iPad.  Jobs did not market test his ideas; he believed that consumers did not always know what they wanted.  He designed a closed ecosystem of computing that allowed him to create and control an optimal and complete computing experience.  For years, his approach was derided as Microsoft grew and grew.  Finally, with the iPod, the iPhone and iPad, the rationale for the closed eco-system took off, making Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world.  As a marketing genius, entrepreneur and visionary, Jobs was incredible.  Jobs demanded perfection from himself and those who worked for him.  As a business leader, there is a lot to learn from him.As a person, Jobs was a flawed (i.e., normal) human being.  He made mistakes and often learned from them.  Jobs was adopted as a baby and well cared for by his adopted-parents.  Yet, as a young man, Jobs fathered a child and essentially abandoned her.  Later in life, he brought her back into his life.  This is surprising behavior from a man who presumably should be most sensitive to the damage caused by abandonment.  As a boss, he could be demeaning  and unnurturing.  His ability to warp reality (what those around him called the ""reality distortion field"") was not only a powerful business tool, it also carried into his personal life with negative consequences.  When Jobs was first diagnosed with cancer, the man who was at the forefront of technology and possessed contacts and money chose to ignore his cancer, essentially trying to will it away and ignore it.  About nine months later, he finally began to come to terms with it and started treating it by more traditional means.Several years before his death but after Jobs knew about his cancer, Jobs asked Isaacson to write his biography.  Jobs believed that his legacy was worth chronicling (as it was).  Isaacson had published successful biographies about inventors/geniuses (Benjamin Franklin: An American Life and Einstein: His Life and Universe; both are excellent reads).  Jobs saw himself as the continuation of these stories.  He was probably right.Isaacson had full access and complete editorial control over the book.  Jobs seemed to have shared everything.  The only criticism of the biography is that Isaacson became to close to his subject.  Occasionally, it shows. Yet, who wouldn't be in awe of the man who created and/or reshaped the technology, movie, music and mobile phone industries.Two interesting notes for the literary oriented reader.  Jobs dated Jennifer Egan, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of A Visit from the Goon Squad and personally installed a Mac for her.  Jobs' natural sister, Mona Simpson, is a writer, who incorporated her brother and his life into her bestselling books.  The biography is filled with interesting tidbits and should be at the top of everyone's reading list.[Full disclosure -- this review was written on a Dell.  Soon enough, I'll be on a Mac.]"

Incredible, even sensational, motivational book",11/03/2012,"Book review by Richard L. Weaver II, Ph.D.This is a fascinating, if not riveting, story that is not only well-written and well-constructed (organized in a chronological manner), but it is incredibly well-researched, too.  It not only revealed how open Jobs was with Isaacson, but how open all of those who were part of, influenced, or were on the fringes of Job's life, were when Isaacson interviewed them.From reading this book, you get this intricate portrait of a mercurial, sometimes vicious, self-absorbed, genius who had serious difficulties dealing with the realities of day-to-day living.  But, it is Jobs' peculiarities--his uniquenesses--that make this book so engaging.  You simply have a hard time believing such a person like Jobs even existed!  (Remember, Jobs did not read this book before he died.)One aspect of Jobs' personality--reinforced throughout the book--was that ""ordinary rules didn't apply to him"" (p. 313).  I found it astonishing, for example, that he couldn't be relied on to tell the truth.  It was said about him by Helmut Sonnerfeldt, ""He lies not because it's in his interest, he lies because it's in his nature"" (p. 313).  He was adept at misleading, being secretive, as well as being brutally honest.  He could be incredibly brutal!Whatever you thought about Steve Jobs--based on his public persona--this book will shake (destroy?) that image.  Isaacson pulls no punches, nor do the individuals interviewed.  Jobs was a temperrmental, insensitive, authoritative, control freak, with an emphasis on freak!  Sure, he was incredibly bright, imaginative, creative, intelligent, educated, and knowledgeable, but the way he treated others, the way he thought about others who were not his intellectual equals (or intellectual superiors!), was near pathological and perverse.  He was an egomaniac's egomaniac (terribly selfish and demanding).  To give you a mere glimpse of how selfish he was, he seldom remembered anniversaries or birthdays (p. 530).Jobs was not one to emulate when it comes to effective human relations, however, even though many of his personal eccentricities were not exemplary, this is a motivational book.There are a number of great motivational messages throughout the book.  Some of the messages include: never give up, create a vision or dream, pursue your dream, whatever it takes, surround yourself with great minds and supportive personnel (not just ""yes people""), don't worry about going against the grain, be creative, take risks, defy failure, bet your career on doing things in a different way, be hands-on, know your product, be thorough, check-and-re-check, perfectionism is good and it works, have passion, infuse everything you do with emotion, focus, prepare thoroughly, do nothing half-assed, and always keep your customers in mind (be user friendly).  Jobs knew that ""deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do"" (p. 336).On the basic values Jobs supported--and a value seen in every Apple product which he oversaw (and a value that made Apple successful!)--is the effective marriage between technology and the humanities (p. 527).  The marriage was consummated in the silicon architecture, in the Aple organization, as well as in Jobs' own soul (p. 527)!If you really want an overview of who Steve Jobs was and how he operated, Isaacson does a beautiful job of summarizing in Chapter 42, ""Legacy"" (pp. 560-571).  It is an honest, complete, and intimate conclusion that accurately and completely draws together many of the comments, reactions, and insights scattered throughout the book.  It is a wonderful closing chapter.In this final chapter, too, Isaacson allowed Jobs, who had shared with him what he hoped his legacy would be throughout the course of their conversations, to be the one to conclude the book (pp. 567-570).  No, there are no completely new insights in Jobs' essay, because you absorb his personal values, approaches, feelings, and reactions throughout the book, but Isaacson was correct, just hearing Jobs express himself at the end was a beautiful, warm, and touching way to conclude the book.  Just as Jobs was a true genius (very few measure up!), Isaacson is a genius in the manner with which he introduces him to the general public.  This is truly an incredible book."

Deeply disappointed in the lack of a deeper insight, but still an exciting read.",11/11/2011,"I'm among those who felt sorrow at Steve Job's passing. I must confess, not so much for him and his family as for the rest of the human family. That said, my heart does very much go out to his wife and children and to all those who loved him. I have no doubt that his absence is leaving an enormous hole. Why I am so sad is because I think the order of his accomplishments is on par with Prometheus bringing fire to humanity and he had it in him to do so, so much more.""Steve Jobs"" was a riveting, fast and easy read, utterly fascinating because Jobs' life, accomplishments and personality was so. The rise of consumer technologies changed our world dramatically and it's surprising what an exciting story it makes. It's fairly clear to me that, had Jobs allowed others to temper him any more than they did, or had he done so himself, we would not be enjoying the fruits of his labor. He was of a piece and his products a clean expression of him.I read the book on my iPhone, using the Kindle app. It tells you what percentage of the book you've already read. When, as I was reading, I felt that the biographer was not getting to the meat of Steve's personality, when he failed to explore the deeper meaning of Steve Jobs, I thought there was plenty of time. I didn't realize that such a large percentage at the end of the book would be notes, etc. I was startled and disappointed when the book ended without any introspection around Jobs. This still being a 5 star review is a testament to what an amazing man Steve Jobs was and what a great story the story of Apple is.It fell to Isaacson to gain a deep (40 interviews) understanding of the man, the company, the times and the accomplishments and impact. And by deep I mean, the psychological, spiritual and even transcendent aspects of the life of this man who had such an extraordinary effect on so many of us. Isaacson, regrettably, truly and utterly missed the opportunity, to do so. It seems he made lots of notes and cobbled them together well. The reader gets many facts and quite a few opinions, but what is utterly lacking is insight.I don't understand how Walter Isaacson, an important man with many great responsibilities, could fail so completely in delivering insight that comes from a soulful understanding, that is overarching and gazes beyond the surface. Does he, himself, lack introspection and an active and conscious connection with his own subconscious, soul and spirit? Did he not see the mythological, another fine intersection, this one of the worldly and the transcendent? If he had made this connection he could have given us Steve Jobs and the story of Apple in a way such that we could apply it to our own lives, as the mythological is a universal context.But there is no one to blame but Jobs, I fear. He selected Isaacson and in those forty interviews, considering his perfectionism, as described by Isaacson, should have spotted the glaring absence of the special quality in the questions that allows for this deeper insight and revelation. It seems we will have to contend ourselves more so with his products than with insight into what made this all possible. And maybe that's okay. Maybe he couldn't be copied anyway; not everyone can be.The one hope I hold out is that, over time, Isaacson will gain a better understanding of what he got in those interviews, that things will gel and that he, himself will grow and that he will write another book that gives us what was absent in this one. To be fair, he was rushed. Steve Jobs did die too young.Addendum:It didn't happen right away, as my glowing review evinces, but something unexpected has transpired in the little over a year since I read this book. Before doing so, I was a genuine Apple and Steve Jobs admirer. It appears that ""Steve Jobs,"" ultimately, was a turn-off. I experience none of the enchantment I once felt with Apple and its products."

Well written and insightful with some flaws.",05/06/2014,"Cold Fire is Book 3 of The Circle Opens (the world of Emelan). I picked this up as I am a Tamora Pierce fan and loved her Tortall books. This is a well written, frightening and confronting look at arsonists. The world building is detailed and wonderfully done. Most of the characters (of all genders) are flawed, interesting with their own histories. The protagonist is sympathetic, courageous and intelligent. I also liked how there were characters from various multicultural backgrounds portrayed sensitively. The plot is very dark and gritty, and focuses on the aftermath of arson, the mindset of arsonists, and the effects of family violence and abuse.SPOILERS:I was disappointed that the only male victim of abuse ended up being a horrifying character. I'm sure Tamora Pierce didn't intend to portray male victims of abuse as solely being unsympathetic, but that was impression from the book I got.There's some strong language and swearing. Overall the book is very well written. This is definitely not comfort reading and is quite frightening (this is not criticism, it just means that this book will not be everyone's taste). The ending is also heartbreaking and sad. Best read with the lights on."

If this book is supposed to have a mystery, make the mystery actually like one. Sure, the person who's the culprit is like the last person you'd expect, but the book told us who, so what's the point? Seriously, if you want villain POV, use all pronouns, and say 'the' firefighters instead of 'my' firefighters. So while reading this people are mentally yelling: STOP MAKING EXCUSES DAJA AND FREAKING FIGURE OUT THAT BEN IS SETTING THOSE FIRES! Or something like that. Not guessing a mile away from the true culprit, which I would think a solve-the-puzzle should be aiming at. Point is, telling us the culprit early on is taking the fun out of it."

Worth reading the mediocre first two books to read this finale",26/04/2018,"Bitterblue is the best book in this series by far. After we left Princess Bitterblue in Graceling, I was curious to see how her future would turn out now that Leck isn't at the helm of her life. I'm glad she got her own story, and I can't believe I almost didn't read this book because I didn't love the last two. This book is worlds better than the other two, and Cashore's writing has significantly improved since book one. Although Bitterblue follows characters introduced in Graceling and features cameos from characters in Fire, I do think it could be read as a standalone, or as a sequel to Graceling, omitting Fire. I will say having the knowledge from Fire definitely added to my reading experience of this book, but it is not pertinent to read that book prior to Bitterblue.I loved the characters in this story. Bitterblue is lovely (I actually like her more than Katsa), and it was so nice to see how she's matured since her childhood in Graceling. Moreso, I loved the evolution and progression of her character and strengths from the beginning of this book to the end. Cashore has a talent for writing really strong female leads that have great arcs of character development throughout the story, being tested in many ways but always emerging triumphant and stronger in the end. Of all the characters in this book, I think I liked Sapphire the most (and his name is pure gold). He was unpleasant at times, but I continued rooting for him and I loved when he showed up in scenes. He, too, goes through some nice moral changes as the story progresses.My very favourite scene in this whole book is when Bitterblue walks into the courthouse while Saf is on trial. I listened to that part of the book on audio, and I was laughing so much at how ironically funny it was. Simply charming.One thing I wish we were given more details about was the romance. Bitterblue and Sapphire had a kind of relationship that could have been more intimate than we saw it, but we don't know what happened to them after the story ended. Bitterblue also seemed fond of Giddon, but their relationship was always only platonic. I could see it turning into something more in the future, but we readers won't know what happens with Bitterblue's possible suitors because the story was left open-ended with this matter.In Bitterblue, the use of ciphers and codes and secret messages is paramount to the story. I've always been interested in that kind of thing but never had an aptitude for it, so I enjoy reading about it in books from time to time, watching the characters figure out the puzzles piece by piece. Each new message that Bitterblue deciphers or each code that she had to break had me completely enthralled with how detailed they were, how complex they were to solve. And their prevalence goes to show that Bitterblue really couldn't trust anyone. Truly, I had no idea who was on her side and who was putting on a facade. People were changing their allegiances in the middle of the book, discovered to be an enemy but then ended up being an ally, and vice versa. That is one thing Cashore did really well in this book: she had me completely unable to trust any of the characters. Even the main characters that were most present in the story were under scrutiny from Bitterblue, and I can't imagine that strain on her as an emerging queen. Luckily, all answers were elucidated by the end of the book.I did think it was weird, for how focused on characterization Cashore is in her writing, that we never got to meet the spies. Bitterblue mentions her spies quite a bit, and at first I thought that was a pretense for her guards, that her ""spies"" were actually herself and Saf and Teddy. But then I realized she actually does have spies, but we never got to meet them or know their names. I found that a bit strange with how much this book revolves around secrets and the acquisition of information.I like that this book heavily relied on politics, but they didn't control the story like they did in Fire. In Fire, the politics were the story, and the plot became very dry and boring. But in Bitterblue, the politics enhanced the story, and that was so much more enjoyable to me. I think politics are crucial to any good fantasy that takes place in a medieval setting with castles and rulers, but I find that they can make or break my interest in the story.Overall, Bitterblue was an excellent conclusion to an otherwise ordinary trilogy. Cashore's writing has developed greatly since her debut novel, and I believe she will continue to grow even stronger in that skill as time goes on. She writes great characters and interesting political plotlines with shocking revelations throughout. This story was long, but it didn't feel that long because every bit of it was entertaining. One neat thing about this book in particular is the considerable amount of bonus content at the end, which really enhances the reading experience. We have beautiful drawings of the three bridges in Bitterblue City, detailed maps of different parts of the castle and the land, a character list with helpful descriptions, and Cashore's writing process for Bitterblue, which was actually very eye-opening. She wrote two complete first drafts of the story over the course of many years to get all the details of the plot where she wanted them to be. While that would have been a grueling rewriting process, I know that Bitterblue was only better for it in the end."

BitterBlue is Bittersweet",14/03/2013,"Bitterblue is bittersweet - I'm not a huge fan of the ending. Thus the 4 star rating possibly a 4.2Graceling and Fire are standalone books and tie up nicely at the end. I expected the same for Bitterblue as I have not heard any rumors of more books from this realm. I will have to say that honestly it is not tied up neatly at the end. It still seemed like there should be one more book following this as all the Characters are leaving Bitterblue to go off on escapade that they had used Monsea as a homebase for as they floated in and out of the story with plans to be back shortly. Sometimes I was more interested in the story of Po, Katsa and the Council than Bitterblue's.Bitterblue's story is engaging. It was a puzzle and a mystery the whole way through with little glimpses of the pieces coming together each chapter. The slight romance between Bitterblue and Saf was cute but very similar to the other push/pull romances of the previous two books. While enjoyable for me there could have been more of it. At times Saf drops out of the book for chapters held up somewhere, he and Bitterblue, not interacting for weeks of the story. So many new characters, it was sometimes hard to build a connection to them and feel appropriately when their stories played out.Leck is still a super bad bad guy. He ranks right up there with Geoffry Barrathion for the most sadistic bad guy award. I liked learning why the kingdom was having trouble recuperating still after 8 years of a Leck free society. Mind wiping can do that to you I guess.The parts of the book I most enjoyed are when Bitterblue is sneaking out of the castle to see her city and to hear the stories in the fable rooms. Then the story gets a little long in the middle and you are ready for it to be over. It picks up again by the end and I didn't really want it to end.It was great to have some of the previous characters in the book again. Po and Katsa I love them (there was a lot of Po and not a lot of Katsa though) Raffin and Bann along with Giddon were fun to catch up with. Also, an appearance from Fire that was very short but there none the less. Even though Saf was always deemed a wanderer and a slight cad I sorta thought that story line might play out differently and was a little disappointed but he was missing from so much of the story that I really wasn't heartbroken or as heartbroken as I maybe should have been."

Kristin Cashore knows what she's doing!",15/06/2012,"So words cannot quite express the amount of excitement I had for this book's release. I absolutely loved Cashore's other two books: Graceling and Fire.  I remember talking about Fire with a friend who'd read it before me. She told me it was better than Graceling, and of course my response was, ""How can anything be better than Graceling?"" And now when I find myself describing these books to people, I find myself leaning more toward Fire than I originally thought I would.It is a rarity for me to ever really like book 2 more than book 1. Needless to say, I had high hopes for this one. I didn't like this one more than Fire, but I was still really impressed with it. Instead of making this book about someone graced with a powerful ability or about someone considered a monster for their rarity and gifts, Cashore finally writes a book about someone normal...or as normal as a queen with no magical abilities can be. And while the characters of her other books lived through some seriously harsh situations, they always seemed to epitomize the word strength to me. They always kicked some serious butt. And I loved them for this.Bitterblue, lacking in a grace, kind of comes across as the opposite. And it took me a little while longer than I was expecting to love her as a character. Sure, I felt sorry for her immediately. Her life was anything but easy. But, I didn't love her until she really seemed to take on her role as queen, and my goodness did she take this role to heart.The book takes place almost a decade after King Leck's death. Leck, Bitterblue's father, was as evil as evil tyrants come. He was graced with the ability to control people's minds. And he did some extremely horrifying things with his ability. Bitterblue knows which people she shouldn't mention Leck around at all, because each person who suffered through the man's reign, is still suffering afterwards.A lot of this book deals with truth. It's about Bitterblue learning the truth about what her father really did, beyond what she saw. It's about her advisers wanting to keep the truth about King Leck at a distance from Bitterblue and away from everyone it could hurt. It's about keeping certain truths to yourself out of fear. And then of course it's about dealing with the truth and suriviving with it, after you know it.Bitterblue, in a rather Jasmine-ish fashion has to escape the confines of her castle at night, dressed as a man, to explore the land she is meant to be the ruler of. She finds herself loving the nightlife and learning about her people by going to various pubs and listening to stories. People tell stories about history, about King Leck, about Bitterblue's famous and wonderful friends, and about so many things that Bitterblue has never heard. And these stories begin her quest for truth. Why does no one in her kingdom seem able to read, even when her advisors say that most can? And why is nothing quite as she is told it should be?She befriends a thief and printer (Saphire and Teddy), and pretends to be someone she's not. She learns about truth-seekers and people who work to steal things back from King Leck. Her new friends steal things her father had stolen and give them back to their rightful owners (in a Robin hood type fashion). Though, in a lot of cases, the things go to the owner's children because most of the owners were killed by Leck.There's revolutions, new lands discovered, old friends joining up with new friends, romance, treason, hidden passageways, mazes, art, prisons, lots of betrayals, lots of owning up to past lies, kidnapping attempts, fighting, suicide, depression, and so much planning!This was not an easy book to read. So much of it dealt with recovery. Leck raped, tortured, experimented on, ruined, and hurt so many people. The extent of his evil is fully learned by Bitterblue, after much digging, deciphering, and learning. All of the adults in this book had suffered so much. Everyone has lost someone. And it was horrifying to think of all the damage just one man could create.I loved the power of words in this book! Between one character writing a book of words, all the characters writing in code, the bars where stories were told, the embroidered words Bitterblue's mother left for her in her blankets, the journals Bitterblue and her awesome librarian deciphered and managed to use to learn about Leck, the powerless people's illiteracy, and the illegal printing presses, so much seemed to about language, and it all connected so beautifully!I also grew to love Bitterblue. Instead of complaining about her ignorance, she did something about it. She learned from her mistakes, and she went about solving her problems so bravely. She's such an intelligent and loyal main character. Her attachment with characters from the other books was wonderful. Her friendships with people in the castle were adorable. And I loved how much she wanted to learn, how much she wanted to be queen, and how much she wanted people to be able to move on.It did move a little too slowly for my liking. I'm not sure all the stuff about the revolutions and wars amongst the other kingdoms was necessary. Though, I really did end up feeling as Bitterblue felt, so frustrated and impatient for news or things to happen, and incapable of making them happen myself. Cashore knows how to write characters, create worlds, instigate action, prolong nice romance, and really just make a fantastic book.I give this one a 10/10. I did not like it as much as the other two, but I really can't find much in the ways of flaws. As with the first two, I'm still letting this book sink in a bit. I really hope Cashore continues to write, and I look forward to anything she would have to say in the future."

EXCELLENT Book, but Less Fantasy than the Others",08/05/2012,"In a world where people are Graced with special abilities and a man controlled his kingdom in a thirty-five year reign of terror, how is an average eighteen year old girl supposed to run her kingdom? And how can she and the rest of the kingdom ever recover from the terror her father imposed on so many people? In Bitterblue by Kristen Cashore, we get to see how the main character, Bitterblue, is fairing eight years after that fateful day Katsa and Po saved her from her psychotic father in Graceling.Bitterblue became queen at the age of ten, so she has spent her adolescence relying upon the help of her advisors to run the kingdom. Now that she is older, she feels like something is missing. She trusts the men who advise her, but at the same time she thinks they are keeping things from her to protect their young queen. Not one to sit idly by, she decides to take matters into her own hands and explore the city. Dressed in disguise as a young boy, Bitterblue hits the streets where she encounters a pair of young men, one of whom is Graced. The Graceling, Saf, is a bit cantankerous, but his friend Teddy is delightful and trusting. Through the unlikely pair, who don't know Bitterblue's true identity and refer to her as Sparks, Bitterblue learns more about her own kingdom in a few short meetings than she has in years in the castle.When Katsa and Po return from their mischief and mayhem in the world at large (actually overthrowing tyrannical kings, but they like to think of it as mischief), they find Bitterblue in a state of confusion. It is clear people have been lying to her, and there are things going on in her own city, let alone the entire kingdom, that she won't accept, but she doesn't know where to seek the truth. Bitterblue knows her father's 35 year reign will unlock the keys to everything that is happening in her kingdom, but no one wants to talk to her about the atrocities her father made them commit with his mind control. Slowly, Bitterblue uncovers the truths everyone has worked so hard to hide, but that doesn't necessarily mean she will want or need to know those truths to be the queen her kingdom needs.We loved Graceling because of Katsa and Po and their amazing graces and incredible world. We loved Fire because of Fire herself and the fascinating and morbid lives of the monsters in the Dells. Now we love Bitterblue for an entirely different reason. While the world and the graces are still there, this is a very different kind of story. It is the story of a young girl who has the weight of responsibility crushing her and she doesn't know how to survive it. She knows her father was to blame for all the evils in her kingdom, but she can't handle the fact that atrocities are still being committed in his name even after his death. The beauty of Bitterblue is that she wants to be a good queen. She wants her people to be well fed and well educated, and most important, she wants them to heal. I love how caring and determined she is and I just wanted everything to work out for her... in particular, where Saf is concerned. This young girl has a lot of horrible circumstances to deal with, but she isn't going to lose herself in them. And that is what makes me love Bitterblue. She is a great female character for all our young girls to read about.I have heard people scoff at the relationships Cashore portrays in her novels, saying they are too mature for YA audiences, but I totally disagree. She has men loving men, women loving women, and men and women having caring relationships without marriage. To be honest, to Cashore, the emotion of love transcends an official ""marriage"" and focuses on something deeper and more pure. I love how tactfully she does this and think those nay-sayers should pipe down and appreciate the strong, caring, multi-dimensional relationships Cashore has created. I appreciate this diversity! I also appreciate the understanding that students are surrounded by relationships beyond the typical ""man/woman/marriage"" and should see such reality reflected in the books they read.But mostly I just love this series. This is certainly a more realistic and less fantastic story, although the fantasy is still there, around the edges. You may be surprised by the differences in this story vs. the first two books, but I suspect you will be pleasantly surprised. I also had the privilege of meeting Kristen Cashore last week at our local indie bookstore and was absolutely blown away by her! She was so honest and humble about her writing process, and meeting her made me love her stories even more than I had before! So if you haven't started this series yet, good god(desses), what are you waiting for! But be sure you have some time to devote to the series because once you start, you won't be able to stop!"

Best in the series",28/05/2021,"TW for Bitterblue: S*icide, S*lf-h*rm, T*rture, R*peThis is the story after the story. What happens after the evil king is defeated, and the kingdom must stitch itself back together? The heroes have bravely defeated the villain, but the story isn’t over yet. Now, a kingdom must put itself back together after decades of violence and trauma. In Bitterblue, Cashore explores this theme with such complexity and grace, weaving a story of trauma, growth, and forgiveness.There are so many things I loved about this book that it would take me ages to write them all down (and I definitely don’t have the energy anymore, seeing as I just finished writing this review and then immediately afterwards accidentally deleted it). By far my favorite book in the series, Bitterblue contains a variety of characters, both new and returning, that are fully fleshed out and three-dimensional. There are several LGBTQ characters and couples, both f/f and m/m, including a bisexual love interest (finally!).(I have tried to include no spoilers below, but proceed with caution!)One of the main themes I wanted to discuss is that of physical touch . Before his death, Leck used his powers to impose harm, both physical and mental, on all those he could ensnare. Any mention of him throughout the book contains some mention of his penchant for torture. All instances of physical touch related to Leck, therefore, have a negative connotation. The way that Bitterblue herself deals with touch is a fascinating parallel to her journey to establish herself as a queen after Leck’s reign of terror, in a time when many scramble to move forward, others find themselves imprisoned in the past, and many, both peasants and nobles, seek out that which Leck took from them. When Bitterblue is compared to Leck, her touch is violent, causing pain. This happens when she slaps the same character that accuses her of being too much like her father, in the midst of her own internal crisis at her apparent mirroring of Leck’s actions. Throughout the book, when she is trying to work through her own traumas, depression, and PTSD, she desperately seeks out comforting physical contact (especially from Katsa and Po). One of the most interesting occurrences, in my opinion, is when she is lost and confused in the fog that Leck left in his wake, and in that moment reaches out to touch a piece of dough, soft and warm, which helps her escape his snares.I really only had to complaints with the book, but I think both mirror the storyline so I can easily look past them:1) the beginning of the story is a bit confusing and overwhelmingI found it hard to keep up and get the facts straight, but I think this is exactly how Bitterblue felt. Frustrated and confused, she receives contradictory information and wonders who exactly it is she can trust.2) the first two parts of the book were quite repetitive and somewhat boring.Bitterblue is in her office. She doesn’t like her duties. Her advisors avoid her questions. She sneaks out. she goes to hear a story. She meets up with her friends. They give her a starkly different view of her kingdom than her advisors. Rinse and repeat for about 200 pages.Again, this is quite reflective of Bitterblue’s frustrations, and she voices this several times."

This one was kind of ""Eh"" for me... **Contains Spoilers**",03/09/2012,"I'll just start off with the fact that I LOVED both Graceling and Fire.  They are two of my all time favorite books.  I am sad to say that Bitterblue had not made the cut.  I've read a lot of the reviews that talked about way more indepth stuff than I am going to talk about - I read this for entertainment only and have not analyzed the author's motives or any of the themes presented throughout the book or anything like that.  The reason that I personally didn't thoroughly enjoy this one is that too many things seemed to be glossed over or were left unexplained.***SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT***I enjoyed this story up until the point that Bitterblue was attacked. There was a lot of action and changes of setting.  After Bitterblue's attack everything took place pretty much in the castle/Bitterblue's rooms (and not much even happened).  This was really boring for me.  I pretty much had this stagnant mental picture during the rest of the story.I found Bitterblue's relationship with Saf to be frustrating and a bit confusing.  The romance was poorly developed even for not being central to the plot.  It was like oh we're friends - now we're kissing - and we're not friends anymore - and now we're being civil - and then all of a sudden we're sleeping together (and apparently friends again) - and then its just ""Well, I'm leaving now you seem to be okay with that, bye"".  I was not sure if there was even going to be a romance for Bitterblue up until ""Now we're kissing.""  I could never really tell if Bitterblue actuallycared about Saf in a romantic way or not.  I would have preferred there to be no romance at all than to have gone though this disappointment.Furthermore, I felt like the last few parts of the book were underdeveloped (probably from the time Runnemood's body was found to the end).  You never really get a good understanding of what is going on and many of the events are made unimportant since Bitterblue doesn't really witness them they are just hearsay from her advisers.  I understand why the author didn't go so in depth as to what was actually in the journals, since it was a bit disturbing, but she neglected to mention Leck's motivation behind his actions and you don't really end up with a good picture as to why everyone is still so messed up 8 years later.  I mean seriously, how did the kingdom function with these people in charge for so long?  If they were still so  messed up I am not sure how they got themselves out of bed everyday to even do any work - good or bad.The ending was probably the most disappointing.  I knew that it would be like this when I got down to 100 pages left and NOTHING was beginning to get resolved.  New questions were still popping up.  Too many things were just tied off in a sentence or two and it was really unsatisfying.  Bitterblue & Saf's parting was especially irritating, I find it hard to imagine that she'd be so okay with him leaving like that.  We have no idea how things turn out in Estill (and there was too much talk about it to not find out) or the other kingdoms or if Bitterblue's plans of remuneration are ever carried out or if she ever gets to know her kingdom better outside of the castle.  I do hope that there will be a sequel or something to tie off these loose ends and fill in the gaps. I really hate glossed over endings, if not for that, I would have probably given this 4 stars.On another note:  I did like seeing Fire, Katsa, and Po again (although Katsa and Po were a bit annoying at times).  I also liked Bitterblue as a character - she was kind and thoughtful, and seemed to deeply care about her people even when they betrayed her.  I liked Madlen and Teddy as well.  Saf would have made a great romantic male lead (like Po for Katsa or Brigan for Fire) or a great partner in crime/friend (Raffin for Katsa or Archer for Fire), but instead his character ended up being a bit ""blah"" as he didn't fit into either category for me really.  He was sort of like a side thought put into the story because the author thought she needed a romance.  If you took him out of the book you'd still have pretty much the same story."

A book of aftermaths and new beginnings",07/05/2012,"This is the best YA fantasy I've ever read about the Rwandan genocide.It's a story about Queen Bitterblue, who came abruptly to her throne at age 10. She is now 18 and still trying to deal with the toxic fallout of her father's reign. Her father Leck was a twisted, evil, sociopath who could literally convince anyone of anything. That pain was pleasure. That love was pity. Anything, and he used this power to try to rebuild his fantasy world, without, of course, counting the cost to anyone. Hundreds died.Her advisors have convinced Bitterblue that the only way for the kingdom to get past this horror is to issue a blanket amnesty for everything that happened in Leck's time, and try to forget it, as a country.The problem is that the country can't forget, and the people who committed atrocities are terrified that the information will come out, and the people who were victims can't just get over it without acknowledgement. Bitterblue is helped by more experienced characters from the previous books, but mostly, she is successful because of her dogged determination to do the right thing, and her skills at making friends. She has a whopping case of imposter syndrome, which is understandable. ""They understood the world and how to mold it. If she could keep them near, one day she'd wake up and discover that she'd become strong that way too."" A budding monarch could do worse.She is forced to understand that the damage done to the country and the people can't be ignored out of existence, and the most important person in the kingdom may be the librarian. Eventually, through heartbreak and peril, she emerges with a new understanding of her own privilege and the perils of being isolated from many viewpoints.In the end, she decides that education and knowledge preservation are important, and then she founds the first royal institute of peace and reconciliation. That's not quite what it's called, but the concept is the same. It's hard to work together as a country if no one has ever acknowledged that they were the perpetrators and/or the victims. I think about Rwanda, and Serbia, and South Africa, and I think about how Leck could make good people do terrible things. I think about the way so few genocidal outbursts involve people making a deliberate decision to massacre their neighbors, but something flips in their mind and a voice comes on the radio and it's all machetes and fear and death.My favorite quote from this book: ""Bacon improved things dramatically."" Because no matter how terrible your night has been, the addition of calories and protein will probably help you deal with it. My favorite Grace is the ability to direct someone else's dreams.Read if: You are interested in the aftermath of bad government, you love ciphers and hidden languages and spunky queens.Skip if: You are looking for something totally escapist. You have issues with people not taking responsibility for your actions. You can't read about past torture."

The sequel to Graceling you were waiting for!",17/04/2013,"Kristin Cashore's third novel taking place in the Graceling realm is a sequel to the first novel in the series, Graceling, and a companion to the second novel, Fire. Please note that this means there will be spoilers for Graceling in this review. Graceling is one of my favorite novels, so I highly recommend that if you haven't read it, go read it now and skip this review (for now).Bitterblue takes place eight years after Graceling, where young Queen Bitterblue has taken the throne in the kingdom of Monsea. Frustrated and overwhelmed by monotonous work in the castle and curious about what really goes on in her kingdom, the naïve but optimistic queen begins sneaking out at night pretending to be a servant girl from the castle. While she is out, Bitterblue befriends thieves who are seeking the truth about the tragedies that took place in Monsea during King Leck's reign. It doesn't take long for Bitterblue to see that her kingdom is not at all what it seems: literacy is atrocious, buildings are dilapidated and truth seekers are being hunted by those who wish to silence the history of Leck's madness. Bitterblue must decide which of her friends and advisors she can trust and learn how to best be queen in a kingdom still haunted by her father's reign.It took me much longer to get sucked into Bitterblue than any of Cashore's other Graceling realm novels; at first the story is kind of all over the place. My biggest struggle was believing that it took Bitterblue eight whole years to finally become so restless that she sneaks out of the castle or wants to be more hands-on as a leader. There was little explanation to why she suddenly made a move to escape and I think eight years was just convenient for her age. I only wish the author would have made a greater effort at reconciling such a large time gap. I think it contributed to me not diving into this story as immediately as the other two books.Once I did get into the story, Bitterblue does not disappoint, similar to its preceding novels. Fans of Graceling will be happy to read a lot about Katsa, Po, Lord Giddon, and Prince Raffin and where they have come in eight years; fans of Fire will also be happy to learn how the kingdom in The Dells is doing. Similar to Katsa and Fire, Bitterblue struggles with the emotional oppression of a paternal male figure (King Leck) and must make reparations for the impact he has made on her personally and on her kingdom. Different from Graceling and Fire, however, Bitterblue reads more like a crime mystery as the reader pieces the kingdom's present story together right alongside Queen Bitterblue.One major theme that is well fleshed out in Bitterblue is the many dimensions of lies and non-truths. Bitterblue struggles with not knowing the whole truth of her kingdom which implies someone or some people are lying to her, if not explicitly, then by keeping her ignorant to important issues. When Bitterblue begins sneaking out at night, she finds herself guilty of the same non-truths. When she creates a false identity to the friends she makes at night, she finds herself outright lying. This brings to question: are all lies created equally? Is it appropriate to lie about certain things or to certain people? How much of the truth is acceptable to withhold? Who can you trust with the whole truth? Who can handle the whole truth? This book does an excellent job of explicating these questions and the answers Cashore gives may not be the ones you expect.I really hope Kristin Cashore is not finished with her books in the Graceling realm. I would really love to hear how Bitterblue's reign continues and as I was a little bit disappointed with the somewhat abrupt ending to this novel. With Cashore's talent for beautiful prose and fantastic storytelling, I hope she continues writing in this realm for many years to come.Bottom Line: Read this whole series, especially if you love action-adventure-fantasy! 5/5 Stars"

A rich, detailed read",09/01/2013,"So I just finished reading Bitterblue yesterday. And I have to say, I really loved it. I know from reading other reviews that many people did not feel as much love for it as I did.First of all, I have to admit that I have not read Fire yet. But I don't think Fire is as connected to this story as Graceling is - so I would advise to read Graceling before this one. It sets the the premise for Bitterblue's circumstance. I really wanted to continue Bitterblue's story from Graceling so I skipped over Fire to read this first (mainly from a lack of time to indulge in both books). I was told that its okay to read them out of order, but I hope to entertain Fire at some point in the future.Bitterblue takes place 8-some years after Graceling. Bitterblue's world is a medieval of sorts, taking place in a land not known to us. After the death of her evil, corrupting father, King Leck of Monsea, at the end of Graceling - 10 year old Bitterblue was left to repair the broken kingdom from his tyranny, lies, and evil acts. Her uncle, King Ror of Lienid, helped set up her rule, but it is ultimately on herself to figure it all out.The book starts as several mysteries start to appear about the state of her country and the repair of her people. She notices the odd behaviors of her employees, but also feels very overwhelmed of the paperwork of trying to run the kingdom. Being so young when thrown onto the throne, she really has a huge task of running the whole kingdom, but the even bigger task of healing the kingdom. Out of desperation, she sneaks off in the night, befriends two common townspeople, and starts to learn of details she never knew: murders of those trying to unravel Leck's lies, a lack in a strong education system, and a poorly ran administration - things she can't explain are still occurring even years after Leck's death. More mysteries start to develop as the book continues on as well as unraveling the mysteries of the past.The book is hearty length, and felt like a long read. However, I never tired of the story - it filled the entire book and never dried. This book, is really, a mystery novel. Bitterblue discovers clues to the past and her current problems gradually, teasing the reader throughout the whole length. Throughout her investigation, Queen Bitterblue is growing on her own - learning more about herself, her sexuality, what it takes to rule the kingdom, the values she favors, and who to trust. The drive of this young woman is remarkable as she really does try to become a really moral queen.I was mildly surprised as to the role that Po and Katsa played in the book; especially Po, who was present in much of the story. I thought their story was tied up in Graceling. However this is still Bitterblue's story, but I was pleased to meet them again. Other characters from Graceling also return.Bitterblue is not full of action - it is a story about mystery and the development of the Queen's character and rule. It is not a story about Katsa, it is a story about Bitterblue, which much different themes between the two. I actually liked the style of this one better, and felt more connected to Bitterblue's kind, logical self - perhaps because I can relate to her more than Katsa's wild spirit. I thought the full story was more intriguing that Graceling. The preference in between the two books probably depends on people's tastes.I was mostly disappointed in the ending, which didn't sum up some of the future's (and romantic) details as I had hoped. Perhaps another sequel is due?Cashore writes a wonderfully detailed novel. Expect some riddles, some romance, and some horrors. The novel kept the suspense, but provided soft moments of reflection between the deep characters. I highly recommend this read if you are okay with a slower, richer story than Graceling."

Three Books, Three Styles",10/05/2012,"After reading the negative reviews on this novel, I wanted to set the record straight for those considering reading it.First and foremost, this is Kristin Cashore's third novel, an extension of the stories begun in Graceling and Fire. These books tell the stories of two wildly different young women: Katsa, a Graced killer, and Fire, a beautiful human Monster. Each of these first two books differs greatly in tone, since Fire is a much more fragile girl than Katsa, who is wildly independent and self-sufficient. Bitterblue is named for the main character, Queen Bitterblue, who is yet another unique heroine. The books do not need to be read in order for readers to enjoy the stories, though this order does present some unique insights into the development of Leck's character.Fans of Cashore's work (myself included) have been anticipating Bitterblue for a couple of years now, and I think that many readers, especially teens, were expecting Bitterblue to be as action-packed as the first two novels. These readers may find themselves disappointed, as this is the tale of a queen who (mostly) plays it safe, remains within her city, and has no special talent for fighting or mind control. Aside from having been born queen, Bitterblue is a normal human being, which is actually rather refreshing, since readers are not Gracelings or Monsters themselves. It gives us an idea of what it feels like to muddle through the Seven Kingdoms world without special, inborn talents. Though this change of character yields very different results from her first two books, it demonstrates Cashore's stylistic nimbleness and prevents her from following the same formulaic, cookie-cutter structures as other authors. I think that many of the people who dislike this book do so because they anticipated a series like The Hunger Games or Harry Potter, in which the story is one continuous arc unified by a single main character. This is not Cashore's yarn and I, for one, love her for it.On the other hand, one way in which all three characters are similar is their sexual freedom, which is refreshing and necessary for young women to see and understand. As twenty-something woman who has spent her fair share of time feeling that sexuality was for boys only, I can honestly say that the care with which Cashore treats the topic of young feminine sexuality is careful, honest, and liberating. Very few YA authors allow female characters to actively participate in their own sexuality, which is too bad. In our post-feminist age, the repression of women's sexuality serves as a patriarchal yoke under which women still struggle despite our supposedly liberated status. All of Cashore's heroines make active choices with regards to romantic companionship; both Fire and Katsa are presented with young men whom they could marry who are acceptable candidates in that they are rich, handsome, and friends, but the chemistry just isn't right, and so each young woman walks away. Meanwhile, Katsa, Fire, and Bitterblue all pursue matches who are men they truly respect and with whom they feel a compatibility of spirit, regardless of rank and convenience. Furthermore, marriage is not pressed as a required state for feminine sexuality to take place, but is offered as a possible state of being for couples who feel comfortable with that level of commitment. I know that this take on marriage and sexuality will be bothersome to some readers, but I feel that this is a conversation that in our Twilight-obsessed world is too often overlooked, to the detriment of young women the world over.The other reason why I loved Bitterblue was because it is a mind-bender. It's like reading a Sherlock Holmes novel in some ways, because little hints and clues from the very first chapter carry over throughout the remainder of the novel. Bitterblue faces betrayal in the present and specters of her family's past, and Cashore does not shy away from these touchy subjects, even though it would certainly have been easy to do so. Yes, there are certainly moments in the novel which most readers will find uncomfortable, but Cashore is willing to take her readers into the dark recesses of the human spirit in order to shed light and prove that tragic histories are not prophecies of future doom. I think that many teens with troubled pasts will find Bitterblue's struggles validating and reassuring because the novel promises that there can be peace after terror.Overall, Cashore is an author of incredible dexterity. Her work reminds me of Tamora Pierce's writing in many ways (an author she herself claims as a source of great inspiration), and I anticipate only great things from her in the future, whatever characters and universes she chooses to bring to life."

Not as great as Fire & Graceling but still good",04/01/2013,"Ten Likes/Dislikes:1. (+) Bitterblue, the protagonist - The focus of this book is on how Bitterblue needs to be emotionally and mentally strong, unlike with Fire and Katsa where the focus was more on their special skills and they, as protagonists, needed to accept themselves for who they were... Bitterblue is a refreshingly strong protagonist who's not sword-wielding (well, only to some extent, that is) when most YA protagonists now are either the Bella type or the Katniss type.  Bitterblue is her own, and she's dealing with the ghosts of the past, her father's legacy and the weight of her own ignorance.  She's incredibly easy to sympathize with as well.2. (+) World-building - Loved it!  With the castle's mazes and Leck's strange rooms and portraits and Bitterblue's exploits into the city and more of the Graceling world shown and Monsea's customs, lost to history... Every little detail was just as great and easy to imagine as those in the previous Graceling Realm books.3. (+/-) The Romance - I love Kristin Cashore's writing... And she really knows how to tell a steamy and long romantic story... But I have to say I'm feeling a teensy bit let-down. The romance was appropriate for the story - both characters stayed true to themselves and Cashore does have a way of making anyone seem charming in their own way - but it wasn't as hopeful as it was in Fire and Graceling. I sometimes found myself enjoying the banter/chats Bitterblue has with another male character more rather than those with the primary romantic interest. There was something missing here... I think I didn't feel their chemistry as much as I did for the other characters in her previous books.4. (+) Cameos - I didn't like Giddon based on how he was in Graceling, but I really liked him here. And Po!  Oh, Po--he really steals the show sometimes.  Katsa, on the other hand, kind of bothered me with the way she was acting, but in general I really enjoyed the cameos.5. (+) Themes/Character Development - Some of the best parts of all Kristin Cashore books are the themes she tackles and getting to see the protagonist's character developed. The loss, getting over the ignorance, the confusion, learning how to rule a kingdom, how to be the kind of person she needs to be -- all beautifully done.6. (+) The Prologue - One of the best written scenes I've ever read and definitely the best (and most disturbing) scene of the entire book.  If you don't have a copy of Bitterblue yet, you can read the prologue here on Amazon.7. (+) The Plot - One review that I had read before reading Bitterblue said that its plot was too convoluted for its own good, but I respectfully disagree. I've always enjoyed Cashore's plot twists, and she has plenty of them up her sleeve in this book too.  One thing I will say is that the ciphers confused me when they came up, so I ignored/skipped them and continued reading.8. (+) The Writing - It's Kristin Cashore. I wish I could write like she does.9. (+/-) Pacing - I got quite a bit antsy waiting for things to pick up... but it is a pretty consistent pace throughout so long as you're not bored by that.10. (+) The Cover - I like that all the covers seem to match... but the UK ones are still the nicest. I don't like how feminine they've tried making these covers, with the random facial parts (eye in the key hole) and the grungy curls.Another great Kristin Cashore book, but I enjoyed reading Fire and Graceling more than I did Bitterblue.  Still worth the wait though, and Bitterblue holds its own."

Everything I Hoped it Would Be",07/06/2012,"I don't even know where to start. I really don't. I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible because I know there's tons of reviews out there and I'm not going to say anything that others haven't said already. Plus, I could probably rave about this book for a long time. I'll try to spare you.Bitterblue has been a really long time coming. I think Fire came out in 2009? I've been very anxiously awaiting the third installment ever since then. Needless to say I had some very high expectations for Bitterblue. Every single one of them were met. Bitterblue takes place 8 years after Graceling, and even though it's been years since I read it I fell easily back into the world. The events of Graceling are still very fresh in this book so it all came back, but I wish that I would have reread Fire. It's so interlinked with this story and there's all these subtle things that connect to Fire. I wish that it would have been fresh in my mind. I'm still so, so impressed with how the stories all clicked in the end.Cashore did this very unique thing to me in this book. I started out with an opinion of some characters, with thoughts on what was going on. Then somewhere around the middle of the book she changed my mind. I though maybe I was wrong and I actually had no idea what was going on. Then toward the end my whole outlook changed again! I always had an inkling of who the bad guys were but I never knew for sure. That made the book a roller coaster ride of surprises.There's a spoiler for Graceling ahead: There's not many villains that just completely creep me out. Honestly, there's only one. Leck. I would go so far as to say that he is the best villain I have ever read. When he showed up in Fire as a child I got chills! That has never happened before. In Bitterblue it's been eight years since his death and he is still so much a part of everyone's lives. He's still alive in people's fears and actions. He's still controlling so many people just with their memories of his reign. That whole aspect of the story made it so amazing.I wasn't exactly sure what to think of Bitterblue at first. She kind of lived in a fog but she grows exponentially throughout the book. I really grew to love her. I was so, so thrilled that Katsa and Po are in this book so much. It made me want to reread Graceling. This book is filled with lots of characters, but I found it easy to keep them straight. I liked almost all of them, even some that I shouldn't have liked.Remember when I said I was going to keep this short? Ha!This is one of those books that I wish I could climb into and live in. The world is so extraordinarily developed that I just lose myself in it. Bitterblue is one of those books that I missed for days after I finished it. It was incredible. I have no words for just how incredible. Just read them if you haven't."

Starts off slow, but don't worry, it gets better",24/04/2013,"Originally posted 6/10/12 at Melissa's Bookshelf.Kristin Cashore's companion books, Graceling, Fire, and Bitterblue are some of the most incredible YA fantasy books I have read in the last few years.  Cashore's world-building is first-rate and she has given us a cast of characters that is truly unforgettable.  I loved how Bitterblue masterfully ties together the stories from Graceling and Fire, particularly towards the end of the book.  All of that said, I actually had a difficult time getting into this story -- it started off very slow and it took muddling my way through several chapters before I was finally hooked and didn't want to put it down.  (The slow start is what ultimately caused me to deduct a star in the rating.)But once the story gets going, it moves along at full speed and doesn't let up or hold back.  Bitterblue is much, much darker than the first two books as we take a closer look at the consequences of Leck's disastrous 35-year reign and what it is going to take to heal the kingdom of Monsea.  I was left breathless by some of the dark deeds and events that are revealed.  No, this was by no means an easy read, but that level of twisted detail with which Cashore wrote this tale was absolutely necessary to do the story justice.There are an abundance of new and familiar faces in Bitterblue.  We are introduced to Bitterblue's four advisors, Thield, Rood, Runnemood, and Darby,  their involvement in Leck's experiments during his rule, and the effect they have on Bitterblue and her own reign.  She also crosses paths with small band of ""truthseekers,"" leading to a few side plots that complicate matters for her.  Perhaps my favorite new character is her cantankerous, crotchety librarian, Death (pronounced Deeth).  And of course, we have the return of Katsa, Po, Raffin, and Giddon as they they travel to and from Monsea.  With Bitterblue, Cashore again writes about a strong heroine -- this story is key to her growth and ultimately the truths she uncovers coupled with how she handles the discoveries is what causes her to truly come into her own as Queen of Monsea and the woman she has become.As for the rest, one of my favorite aspects of this novel was the use of mathematics and ciphers -- that provided yet another fascinating bit of intrigue to the tale.  And once again we have a brewing romance, but as with Cashore's other books, the romance is not really a central theme.  Interestingly, I think this practice is an important part of what makes her stories so successful and leave you wanting just a bit more. (And I mean that in a good way.)If you have not read these books, please be sure to read Graceling and Fire (in whatever order you please) before reading Bitterblue.  If you've already read the first two, you will absolutely want to get your hands on Bitterblue."

Flawless <3",06/05/2012,"Bitterblue is a small, 18 year old queen that has an enormous task to complete: Rebuild her kingdom that lives in the fog of her deceased father Leck.Graceling, Fire, and Bitterblue are the three books that you will not forget if you truly love fiction/medevil/ romance novels. All of them have exciting and powerful plots, with heart-wrenching twists and turns. Bitterblue has a unique plot of its own, since this book is about a young queen learning how to manage a kingdom. The romance in this novel is strong and fierce, yet young and scared. The fights were severely toned down from the other two books, since there happens to be no wars in this one. But yet there are several small wars between characters, that more than compensate.Bitterblue, an orphan, had a father who was Graced with telling lies that are always believed as truth, and a mother who was abused by her husband. Leck who was the father was the king of Monsea, and spread his lies all throughout the country and the seven kingdoms. His terrible Grace strengthened his power over Monsea. This hell of a king had a secret; he had an obsession with cutting animals while they were still alive, and keeping them caged up as we learn in the other books. But he also enjoys harming women and little girls, including the ones he ""kept for himself"" such as Ashen, Bitterblue's mother. Countless times, BItterblue remembers those horrific memories of her mother and father, and it troubles her and those closest to her. She tries to rule a kingdom while coping with a horrifying childhood, not to mention her advisers and the entire staff who also were affected by Leck's lies. She very barely carries on throughout the novel, and learns more and more about her maniacal father and how she and her kingdom came to be. On a night out, she meets two young men who both befriend her easily. But what they don't know about Bitterblue brings their friendship into hot water, and she has to decide whether her reputation is more important than saving her friend's life. Love blooms, and Bitterblue takes it on as yet another thing to cope with during those trouble times.My favorite thing about this book is that it kept surprising me. The twists and turns left me gasping and whispering ""no way"" and ""oh my god"" and ""it can't be!"" to my iPad, oh on the verge of tears when it brought up memories of Bitterblue's mother. But what has to be the best part is when==================SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!=================all three books come together. I NEARLY FAINTED!! I started shaking as soon as it was announced that Fire had arrived at Bitterblue's castle, and I couldn't be a more ecstatic reader at that moment. Kristin Cashore has created another dazzling novel that more than raises the bar for me on the fiction/medevil/romance scale. She, as always, leaves me with a warm and tingling heart after reading her books, and I can't wait to read the book again, completing my endeavor of reading the entire series(? is it a series?) twice!!! Im going for three times now!!!!"

Kristin Cashore's Third Book",02/09/2012,"This is Kristin Cashore's third and newest book about the Graceling realm. It is set ten years after Graceling and ten years after Leck has been killed. Bitterblue, now queen of Monsea and eighteen years old, is struggling with the country that Leck has left behind, which was under his tyrannical rule for thirty-five years. And his influence is still lingering. Bitterblue must venture into the city and see what is really going on. And all her advisors have been acting strangely too. We're not sure who to trust.One thing I liked about this one is that a lot of characters from Graceling are in it: Giddon, Raffin, Bann, and of course, Katsa and Po. Also, Fire makes an appearance towards the end as well, as an old woman, in her 70s or 80s. Bitterblue has a lot of intrigue in it, and it was nice to revisit the same world. One thing I can't help wondering is, what has Bitterblue been doing for the past nine years? Has she just been sitting around? Why is she only now realizing that all is not well in her land?In this one, we get to learn a lot more about Leck and really his murderous and insane tendencies, which continue to reverberate throughout Monsea, and all the seven kingdoms. Cashore portrayed him very well indeed; his madness and cruelty towards people and animals alike.There was a lot going in Bitterblue: many of the kings are being overthrown (with the help of the Council), many suspicious murders and fires are happening, new insights are being found into the mysterious land over the mountains to the east, and Bitterblue has been sneaking out into the city at night (I can't believe I didn't mention this before!). She meets two thieves/printers, Teddy and Saf. Saf is Monsean born, but being a Graceling (he doesn't know his Grace though), his parents smuggled him to Lienid, where Gracelings are not enslaved to their ruler. They know Bitterblue as ""Sparks"" at first, a girl who works in the bakery. Saf is sort of falling in love with her, and she with him. When her true identity is discovered Saf is furious at first, but continues to help her.As you can see a lot is going on here, almost too much. There are so many narrative threads all once. For example, Giddon. He's a minor character in Graceling (he proposes to Katsa at the beginning of it), but he becomes one of Bitterblue's confidants, someone she can trust. Anyway, though there was a lot going on in Bitterblue, I still liked it as much as Fire, though not as much as Graceling. I would recommend to anyone who loves Cashore's two earlier books.All of my reviews can be read at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."

After Graceling, Bitterblue",07/05/2012,"Both of Kristen Cashore's previous books, Graceling and Fire, were self-contained, stand-alone novels. Though both take place in the same fantasy world, you can read them in any order and walk away happy. Not so Bitterblue, which is all about aftermath and consequences and recovery and every other word you can think up to describe what happens in the wake of catastrophe.It's mostly about what happens after Graceling: after Leck is dead, after the Council has scored enough victories to frighten the other monarchs of the Seven Kingdoms, after Katsa and Po decide to juggle dangerous careers and a passionate romance. After Bitterblue has grown into a young woman, trying to rule a country with advisors who all once served her father, with a population that has been denied education, justice, and official transparency for a very long time.It ought to be a boring book - a great deal of the plot revolves around deciphering codes, old diaries, restoring the library, or distributing educational materials - but it isn't. Not for one word or page. Kristen Cashore's prose is as gorgeous and emotionally intense as ever, her characters as tightly strung and compelling. In some ways it's a bigger book than Graceling or Fire, because of the protagonist, Bitterblue. She's a queen, responsible not just for her own happiness but that of her country. She can only succeed as a protagonist by finding a way to heal the wounds left by Leck within every caste, at every level of government.There is a romance, but it's left unresolved - even more so than in Graceling or Fire. Bitterblue isn't just a book that wraps up old threads; it also ties Graceling and Fire together (we actually get a really wonderful cameo from Fire herself towards the end), and lays out a ton of new potential plot threads. I admit that I found the ending a little bit underwhelming and a little bit too optimistic, considering how dark this book became in places, which is why it's getting four stars instead of five from me, but all in all Bitterblue was such a wondrous pleasure to read and gave me hope that Cashore will write many more books set in the Graceling universe, all of which I will eagerly devour."

Good, but with its faults",17/05/2012,"(SPOILERS!!)I adore Kristin Cashore's first two books, and I, like many others, eagerly awaited the publication of Bitterblue.  It wasn't a bad book, and I'm glad that I bought it, but when I finished reading it I was disappointed.  I knew before I started it that Bitterblue would be a different kind of book than Cashore's first two.  Graceling and Fire were heavy on the action, while Bitterblue has a much more complicated plot, almost more like a thriller or a mystery novel.  Some people didn't like this change, but I thought the storyline was well done.  I found the plot to be well-paced, intelligent, and page-turning.It took me awhile to pinpoint exactly what bothered me so much about Bitterblue, and I eventually realized that part it was the characters.  I think one of Cashore's greatest strengths as an author is creating wonderful, endearing, realistic characters who you can't help but fall in love with.  Yes, some of my favorite characters popped up, and those were my favorite parts to read, but I just really couldn't connect to any of the new characters in Bitterblue.  Teddy annoyed me because he was written as such a perfect, innocent, wrongly-punished nice guy that I sort of wanted to vomit whenever he appeared (and then there was that cringe-inducing line ""he's only trying to teach people to read!"").  Hava, Madlen, Bren, etc.... I couldn't care less about most of them. Bitterblue herself certainly comes across as intelligent and thoughtful, and I respected her a lot, but I didn't love her the way I loved Katsa, Fire, Nash, Po etc.... or even as much as I had loved Bitterblue's younger self in Graceling.  And Saf?  I was completely uninterested in his character.  If someone can give me any qualities of his that were supposed to make us really care about him, I would honestly love to hear them.  He meets Bitterblue, is sort of nice to her, gets angry with her, steals her crown, spends the majority of the novel making her beg for forgiveness, sleeps with her, then leaves her. Soooooo when was I supposed to like this guy? It's definitely a downer when you couldn't care less about the romantic arc of a novel, especially when I loved both the romances in Cashore's previous books.  There were some glimpses of wonderful new characters, basically Death (and Lovejoy), and the villains in the book were truly and horrifyingly villainous,  so I know Kristin Cashore hasn't lost her knack for creating some of the best characters around.  However, on the whole, I feel like she sacrificed memorable characters in order to focus on a more complicated plot.Another thing that bothered me was Cashore's rather heavy-handed attempts at being politically correct.  She obviously cares a lot about showcasing different races and different sexual orientations.  Now you'd be hard-pressed to find another straight, white girl who supports gay rights/racial diversity more than I do, but I felt that Cashore tried a wee bit too hard to insert them into the book.  I like that Raffin's gay, and I think that works, but then she just brings in two random female characters, doesn't have them do much, informs us that they're lesbians who hope the brother of one of them will impregnate them so they can have a kid, and then basically remove them from the plot.  It just felt fake, like maybe she had a homosexual character quota to fill.  Also, now Fire and everyone else from the Dells has brown skin?  Again, this was just sort of thrown in there, after not being mentioned at all in Fire.  I've seen racial diversity done way better, particularly in Ursula K. Le Guin's ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" series.  This just felt like Kristin Cashore was flipping through her books, realized ""oh crap everybody's white!"" then randomly decided to change the race of numerous characters after she's already written a book about them.  It didn't feel real, and I while personally think that ignoring racial and sexual differences is bad, so is awkwardly forcing them into a storyline just to ""prove"" how much you care."

A great novel.",28/07/2014,"A great novel....starts off good and just gets better.  The author takes her time to get deeper into the main characters emotions, and at one point I did cry.  This is a mark of a good story.  I was able to really feel Bitterblues plight. It was well written and I feel the author kind of became an even better author about midway through the book when her story became also about the depth of emotion the main character was in and showing that real time.  There could have been even more of that and some editing of story as it was a lot coming at me, and yet I couldn't put it down.  It was just on the edge of being overwhelming, but still kept a strong story line  could easily follow.  This is definitely a deeper book than graceling, which was more surface also, and yet by the end of graceling, you are getting into the deeper emotions of the characters.  PO is still by far the best character.  He really rocks.  I was a bit disappointed in Katsa and how she came across in Bitterblue; very abbrasive and almost too hard; there wasn't much warmth is her; she needs some warmth.  Her scenes were kind of just thrown in (it felt like).  Po was written with style and grace. Katsa was kind of like this absent character even when she was in the scene; her words never seemed genuine and she was off running around.  In the first book, Katsa is indeed a free bird, but she was also grounded in her love for Bitterblue.  I didn't feel that at all which is disappointing bc the love between the characters is what binds the story; it's what invests me more.  However, there were plenty of other strong and beautiful relationships.  I wouldn;t have minded more time with Saf.  I loved that relationship and was at peace with how it played out.  I loved the main character.  Bitterblue had stoicism.  And Thiel, that was beautifully written, loved that relationship.  All in all an amaaaazing book, and I would buy Cashore's books any day.  I hope she writes a fourth book with BItterblue and how she pulls it all together and maybe weave a story of her finding or re-finding her one true love.......Great work Cashore!!!"

Great fantasy world!",20/11/2016,"It was nice being back in this world. This world is so rich and well developed and it’s just high fantasy at its finest. I loved how this one brought together things from both Graceling and Fire and tied it all up.It may seem obvious, but Bitterblue was the star of the show. It was so wonderful watching her grow into a strong and wonderful queen. She was thrust into this role as a child and now it’s time for her to truly step up and help heal the kingdom from the horrors Leck committed. I loved how strong Bitterblue became and that she was fierce and capable and smart.I of course also loved Saf. It’s hard to not love Saf. He is impulsive and reckless, but he is also strong and brave and fiercely loyal. I think my favorite characters through were of course Po and Katsa. I just loved seeing them again. Graceling is forever my favorite of the series and that is really because of those two. Watching them together after so long just made my heart swell and my feels were in full fangirl mode. We especially get a lot of Po and it was wonderful. I remember loving Po, but it’s been a few years since I’ve read Graceling and I had forgotten just how much I love him and how wonderful he is.As with any Cashore book, Bitterblue had a bunch of moving pieces and layers to the story and that is really what makes her books so great. I loved putting all the pieces together with Bitterblue and I was caught off guard quite a few times.All in all, I’m really glad I finally made time to finish off this series. Bitterblue was a great read and a great way to see some old friends again."

A tremendously beautiful and perfect ending to the Graceling trilogy; hands down the best book I've read all year",05/05/2012,"I have just finished Bitterblue, the highly anticipated third book in the Graceling trilogy. Is it possible to give a book six stars?Bitterblue chronicles the new queen of Monsea several years after the death of her father, the psychopath Graceling, Leck, and the repercussions that are a direct result from his horrific reign of terror. We see her as she grows, seeks out the truth for herself, and are re-introduced to Po, Giddon, Katsa, as well as other characters we have grown fond of.My issue with Graceling was that it started too slow and took me a while to get into. My issue with the second book, Fire, was that it almost got too bogged down in sadness and self-recrimination. Bitterblue had neither of these issues. I was sucked in from the first chapter and savored each word. We are introduced to new characters, all who greatly appealed to me, most of all Death, who is currently one of my all time favorite characters. One can tell that Cashore also loves him as he gets the last word!While the surprises revealed in this book are not unexpected, I found myself still delighted when they came. Furthermore, I thought it was amazing how Leck, a character who has haunted the first two books, was the center of this book. While it is Bitterblue's story, it is also very much Leck's and we get more a sense of him here than in any book although he has died over a decade ago. And the last meeting of old friends-- it was extremely satisfying.Finally, Bitterblue is an incredible protagonist. She is young, but strong and fiercely loyal and incredibly intelligent. We only get a glimpse of her at the end of Graceling, which was enough to make me realize she was worth her own book. Somehow, even though the other two books were wonderful on their own, this book surpasses and triumphs over them all.The balance between spots of humor among friends and the horrors of what have come before is perfect. I do not take this lightly when I say this is the best book I have read all year. A perfect, beautiful, poignant, thoughtful, and worthy conclusion to the Graceling trilogy."
