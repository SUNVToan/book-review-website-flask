Great story, if you like Medieval Fantasy",22/02/2014,"(This is a review of the Kindle eBook version)I'm familiar with the classic DOS/Windows-era game that is based on this book. But it wasn't until I got this trilogy on Kindle that I truly got sucked into another world, another time...The story begins with a brief flurry of action, then slows into almost a mystery (with lots of names and places to follow), before the main action begins unfolding. Once the author got rolling, I was hooked. If you're into this genre of story, you should enjoy this book (and this trilogy). Highly recommended."

Forget the sour grapes. It's a worthwhile read.",21/11/1999,"I've read all of Feist's stuff but I almost passed this one up because of  all the bad reviews.  Well, ignore the reviews and follow your instincts.  If you saw a new Feist book in the store you would snap it up simply  because Feist wrote it and it is a new Midkemia adventure.  And guess what?  You would enjoy it.  I did.  I think all the sour grapes is just  because some people couldn't get the game connection out of thier minds and  it made them hyper critical.  So he made some extra money franchising his  work.  You'd think he made a video game out of the Bible.  Get over it  people.  Its his creation, he's entitled.  It may not be the best  example of his work (my vote is for A Darkness at Sethanon) but all said  and done, it is a good read and worth adding to your collection."

Wow",20/11/2018,"I love all the Riftwar stories. I fell deeply in love with the Mistress series. Lost many nights sleep, because I couldn’t put the book down. I started with hardbacks then to ebooks. In the ebook some things are left out, however they weren’t Necessary however the story line is true to the hardback."

Better than most reviews",31/07/2011,"This book is a fun read and much better than most of the reviews.  If you like Feist you will enjoy this book. The story is not quite the ""I can't put it down."" typeof others but still enjoyable.  I don't understand rating this book 1 star just because it isn't quite as engaging as others.I would rate this 4.5 if I could but due to the other bad reviews I'll bump it up to a 5!"

A decent novelization of a computer game",21/01/2014,"This novel takes one major thread from a computer game with many subplots and tries to make a single narrative of it.  This seems very difficult to me.  This final result is an OK novel, which says positive things to me about the author.  A good novel would have more focus on a primary character's viewpoint and more fleshed out background.  The faults seem primarily a consequence of the choice to turn a game into a novel, rather than on any weakness of the author.Readers who have played the game to the end won't be surprised by the plot twists, which is too bad.  Those who haven't played the game or read other books in this setting may not find the events without sufficient context.My recommendation is to try another book by this author.  If you like it, you may like this one as well."

The worst of Feist's ""good enough"" fantasy books",09/05/2018,"Krondor: the Betrayal is probably Feist's worst book. It has all the issues common to his books, including misspelled names of people or places from previous books. wrong words, repeated conversations with different results, etc. He clearly doesn't have his books edited before publication (with the exception of the final book, Magician's End, which was very tightly written), but it's become clear that nobody familiar with the series (including the author) even bothers to read through it once it's done. Occasionally, the publisher will go back and correct errors (like that one book where the characters present in a scene changed mid sentence), but evidently it's not worth the effort in most of his books.Having said that, the author does get a bit of slack for the lackluster story here, as it wasn't written by him. This book is based on a computer game from the 90's, and the narrative was written (with Feist's blessing) by the developers. It works well enough for a game, but Feist should have approached his novelization with broader strokes. There's a lot of random enemy encounters and glossing over combat; back and forth between locations; side quests; etc., that make the book a bit of a slog—especially for anyone who has played the game already. A good bit of the dialogue is pulled directly from the game, to the point where it feels like Feist was playing the game on one screen and stopping every few minutes to write a couple paragraphs. The book would have been much better served had he simply worked from an outline.If you're reading through all of Feist's Midkemia books, I'd skip this trilogy. It was originally written out of order with the rest of his books, and while it does fill in some backstory for one or two characters in the later books, little that happens here ever gets mentioned again."

It's OK.",24/04/2015,"The description of 3 stars is ""It's okay,"" which is exactly how I would describe this book.  It reads more like I would assume a first draft would be for Feist.  Another way of putting it is that it's like a lot of the self-published books that sell for $1.99 on Amazon; OK but not literary by any means.  I could tell it's based on a computer game; the characters keep going back and forth over a lot of the same geography, which would keep graphic artists and programmers from having to come up with new visuals.  Would I recommend buying it?  Only for Feist fans who know how well he can write.  If you're a newbie, start with the first Riftwar book (available only in paperback) and get to know everyone while their relationships are forming."

lacking feist's usual flair",06/12/2014,"Very disappointing...  I should have read the reviews before buying (based on a video game?!  I never would have bothered) -- but it was Raymond Feist, it was Midkemia, what could go wrong?...I loved the first 13 books.  The original Rift War quadrilogy, the trilogy of 'Mistress of the Empire', the Krondor's sons duology, and the Serpent War saga.  (And personally, I think Feist's greatest is his completely unrelated novel, Faerie Tale.)  But Krondor the Betrayal has a more primitive feel to it.  It seems more amateurishly contrived; before discovering the video game connection, I'd wondered if it was something he'd written from an earlier project that had been abandoned for awhile... there is a definite evolution to Feist's writing skills as the books go along -- but even Magician, though not as eloquently written as those that would follow, was a great, solid story.All that being said, I know what Feist is capable of -- so I'm not going to give up on him based on one weak link... though methinks I'll jump ahead in the chain a bit, skip these sort of ""flashback"" episodes thrown in belatedly, and move on to the Darkwar Saga... and hopefully all can be well with the world again."

I loved Magician and the Riftwar so much",15/12/2016,"Feist's books went so downhill after the Riftwar Saga.  I loved Magician and the Riftwar so much, I was determined to read everything he wrote about this world.  Next in line was the Empire Trilogy, with Janny Wurts, which was absolutely amazing.  I now attribute every bit of that awesomeness to Wurts.  I couldn't wait to get back to Midkemia after the Empire Trilogy, but I've been nothing but disappointed with everything since.  The plot holes, the terrible writing, the boring stories, the horrendous editing - the same conversations happen multiple times between the same people with different outcomes and it's clearly meant to be the first time the conversation is had in both instances, they just forgot to edit out the conversation they decided not to go with.  This particular book is very superficial, very boring, and a complete waste of time.  I've been reading it for a year and still haven't managed to get through it.  I'm only still reading because I spent money on it, so I'm determined to finish.  I won't be reading any more of Feist's work."

Gods this one was bad.",18/03/2021,"I love Feist. I love the Riftwar series. But this one book stands as so amazingly bad. It was a chore to get through. I dont understand how he could drop the ball like this. It sounds like a high-school junior read the first for books and tried his best to write a follow up. Thank God it's over. I guess it's due to the fact that this one was a computer game first, then adapted into a novel? I am committed to reading the entire series, thats the only reason I made it to the last page."

Don't judge these books by the movie !!!",09/05/2008,"This series of books (especially, The Dark is Rising) is one of my favorites.  The recent movie, The Seeker, based on The Dark is Rising, did not do the book justice.  The moviemakers attempt to modernize the story, take out some of the mythological aspects, and add in some teenage angst trivialized the character of Will Stanton (the Seeker of the Signs), whose appeal is in part based on his dual nature as an ordinary 11 year old boy and the last of the Old Ones (immortals charged with the defending the Light against the Dark), and how he adjusts to being both at the same time.These books share some features with some of my other favorites:1)  Harry Potter books by JK Rowling;2)  Artemis Fowl books by Eoin Colfer;3)  Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quartet (A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door; A Swiftly Tilting Planet; Many Waters);4)  The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster with great line drawings by Jules Feiffer;5)  Septimus Heap books by Angie Sage...Septimus, like Will, is a seventh son of a seventh son;6)  Edward Eager's books (Half-Magic, Magic or Not?, Seven-Day Magic, Magic by the Lake, Knight's Castle, The Well-Wishers, The Thyme Garden).I was less enthralled with the Chronicles of Narnia as a child and on re-reading them as an adult....they are a bit preachy...and I never have been able to read through the Lord of the Rings (though I loved the great unabridged audiobook version that I listened to in my car while commuting to work a few years ago prior to the release of the movies).Any of these books can be enjoyed as good stories with quests and adventures, good and evil, with lessons about assuming responsibility, the nature of friendship, perserverance, and loyalty thrown in for good measure.  More literate (usually older) folks can appreciate the linguistic and mythological underpinnings of the books.So if you enjoyed any of the other books I listed above but haven't read The Dark is Rising sequence, why not check it out?  But don't bother watching the movie."

Over Sea, Under Stone was much better",03/01/2024,"Unlike other swords and sorcery books, this book offers no rule set that enables one to understand or anticipate the action.

A classic of the genre",23/02/2014,"""The Dark is Rising"" is the second in the five-volume cycle of the same name by Susan Cooper, and it is here that the tale of the conflict between the Light and the Dark begins to take full shape.The focus this time is no longer on the three Drew children, but on Will Stanton, the youngest of nine children, living in Buckinghamshire.  On his 11th birthday, strange events begin to whirl about him as his small village is beset by a winter storm of historic proportions, animals become frightened and wary around him, and he can't walk past a radio without it breaking into screeches of incoherent static.  Worse than these odd, but ultimately non-threatening issues however, is the sense of deep dread that is descending on his home, and dire warnings that beings called The Walker and The Rider are abroad in the countryside.Will soon learns that he is no ordinary boy, and that he has a major role to play in a cosmic battle that has raged since man first began to walk the earth.  Beset by supernatural enemies, but aided by fierce allies and his own courage, Will must complete a quest that will keep the Dark from rising.The first book in ""The Dark is Rising"" sequence, ""Over Sea, Under Stone,"" was originally written as a one-off, but Ms. Cooper returned to the core ideas of that story and used it as a launching point for a more expansive arc, which begins here.  ""The Dark is Rising"" was a Newbery Honor Book when it was first published, and deservedly so; beautifully written, it is a classic of the genre, with well-composed characters, a sense of wonder, and enough dread based on old English and Celtic mythology to make for a gripping read."

What Harry Potter Is Missing",30/11/2001,"Let's leave aside the question what J.K. Rowling may have pilfered from this classic (on his 11th birthday, the boy discovers he has magical power; his scar wards off evil; etc.).  What do the books of the Dark Is Rising sequence have that Harry Potter does not?1. Mythos.  The Dark Is Rising sequence comes complete with its own universe, myths, cosmic clashes and even eschatology.  Like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, the Dark Is Rising lives and breathes in a very complete world.In fact, Cooper's mythology is adapted (and not adapted very much) from genuine British folklore and myth.  Herne the Hunter, the Drowned Hundred, the Holy Grail, etc.This gives the books a very ""real"", very British feel to them and a lot of depth.  It also means that enjoyment of these books translates quite easily into an interest in British and Celtic history and myth.2. Ethos.  Will Stanton comes into his powers and inherits grave, serious responsibilities.  The Light is engaged not in frivolous games involving broomsticks, but an eternal battle against the forces of the Dark, which seek to destroy humanity.  The Light is love and self-sacrifice; the Dark is hatred and exploitation.3. Just Plain Good Writing."

Interesting but unnecessarily long",25/06/2023,"I read this to my three kids. We had already read the first book. This book started off very suspenseful and interesting, but it seemed to drag out as it went. I feel it could be much shorter without losing anything important. So much of the writing is descriptive rather than dialogue and that gets really boring to read, especially for kids. Pages and pages without anyone talking, just describing scenery and feelings. It was kind of relief to be done with and I don't think we'll read the third. There are much longer books that hold our interest better, so it's not the length that made us lose interest."

Audio Book of ""The Dark Is Rising"" is Exciting",31/01/2010,"I have previously read all of the books in the ""Dark is Rising"" Sequence, and recently decided to buy the audio books for my youngest son, who is 12. The audio book of ""Over Sea, Under Stone"" is good but takes a long time to build up and get the listener's attention. But the audio book of ""The Dark is Rising,"" which is also unabridged, has a good reader, and moves quickly into the plot and keeps the listener engaged. Comparing it to the film ""The Seeker,"" you can see how the film telescopes the plot of several novels in the series and leaves a lot out. If you enjoy listening to audio books with your children or on your own, I recommend getting this series, but starting with this one, since the sequence of the first two books can be reversed without interfering with the cumulative plot. Thereafter I would follow them in sequence. I like the fact that these books, and many other young adult novels, are unabridged, because in these books every word often tells. Whereas I don't mind abridged adult thrillers, since they are usually not that well written in any event, and you listen to them for the plot while on a long trip."

A hallmark of my childhood, doesn't quite live up to my memory of it",14/07/2014,"As a child, I loved this book.  It felt like a great journey into a magical world all around us, a journey we took through the eyes of the protagonist Will Stanton.  When I recently re-read the book with my daughter, I found that it didn't quite live up to my memories of it.  The sense of discovering a hidden side to our world is by far the strongest part of the novel, but reading it now I found the characters to be extraordinarily passive, particularly the main character Will.  Throughout most of the novel he is drawn from place to place, and events bring to him a steady stream of allies, enemies, learning, and treasure--but we rarely see Will taking active steps to control the events around him.  Even his allies seem to spend most of the novel waiting for the right time or events--almost all the initiative in this book is taken by The Dark--but we get to see them very little, and understand them even less.  The result is that when you put the novel down, you may feel like you just saw an interesting landscape--but it is hard to find the conflicts in the story, or the protagonist's response to them, that could have any parallel in real life.Nevertheless, I've awarded it four stars, mostly because of how strongly the book stood out in my mind for so many years.  The sense of excitement at finding hidden depths in our world, of reading a book that could teach you all you need to know of magic in one sitting, of the beautiful and elemental signs, of a race of Old Ones who lived alongside us but carried the memories of a conflict that had spanned millenia--all these and more were fantastic bits of worldbuilding that I now wish had been accompanied by a stronger storyline."

second in the fantasy series for middle readers",12/01/2002,"Will Stanton is the seventh son of a seventh son -- which means he lives in a crowded, noisy family! As the book opens, Will is excited about his approaching eleventh birthday, but he is also alarmed by strange goings on in the neighborhood -- the birds are acting strangely and none of the family's animals will approach him. Soon Will learns why these things are happening. He is about to be indoctrinated into his rightful position as the last of the Old Ones -- an ancient race that has been protecting the world from the conquest of evil. Now it's Will's turn to shoulder some of the burden and participate in the struggle. That's an awful lot for an 11-year old to take on! But Will is not alone. He meets others who will help him, in particular Merriman, a gruff but kindly mentor figure.""This night will be bad. And tomorrow will be beyond imagining."" Susan Cooper is a gifted writer and she sets a mood of foreboding creepiness right from the beginning. While there is an almost constant aura of menace, there is minimal violence, and Will constantly learns lessons of bravery, honor, and the importance of knowledge and learning. Sort of H. P. Lovecraft meets the Hardy Boys.I agree with some criticism that there is too little struggle and problem solving involved in actually getting the six signs Will needs to find, but the story is still strong and a worthwhile read for middle readers."

A Well Written Book, Recommended",08/03/2014,"'The Dark is Rising', the second book in the 'Dark is Rising' series, is a very popular book, and highly recommended by my families and friends. I purchased this book based on the glowing reviews written by other delighted customers on this website and store, Amazon, and this book has lived up to my expectations.  After reading this book, I now understand why most of the trustful customer reviews highly praise this particular book, 'The Dark is Rising'. This book is well written and has many descriptive passages, so it did not surprise me that the writer, Susan Cooper studied J.R.R. Tolkien's ( ""Lord of the Rings"" ) writing style in his passages.  However, along with it's well written passages and it's skillfully woven myths, this book is relatively simple with no good vocabulary, so I would definitely NOT reccomend using the writing in this book in any way before an exam or test.  But overall, I would recommend reading this book for fun or leisure. Happy Reading!F. Wu"

Wonderful Book and Series",04/04/2022,I enjoyed this book (and series) as a child and as an adult. It's an epic story of good (the Light) trying to triumph over evil (the Darkness). It's about the  characters who must play their part in helping the Light prevail against the rising Darkness. And the sacrifices that sometimes must be made.There are five books in this series. I recommend reading them all in order.

Well written, but ultimately disappointing",20/08/2009,"I purchased this book based on the strength of the glowing reviews on Amazon, which usually are a reliable guide.  I enjoy good fantasy fiction, and was looking forward to a different take on familiar story lines in this novel.The writing, plotting, and characterization are all strong - the author is clearly skilled at her craft.  However, I found the novel, ultimately, to be an unsatisfying experience, which failed to live up to the strong reviews, and not worth the time I invested in the book.While I found the main character sympathetic, there were several elements that just didn't work for me - they didn't draw me in fully.  First, the main character - a young boy - transforms himself too quickly and painlessly to a more knowing state.  One expects something more of a coming of age tale, and one does not get it.  He magically acquires the knowledge he needs. OK.... so perhaps he will make some mistakes given his youth and inexperience? Perhaps his emotions will get the better of him and lead to some crisis that will keep our interest?  Not really...  Things proceed a bit too smoothly for our hero, for my tastes.Second, the ""villain""/antagonist of the work is amorphous - it is... the ""dark.""  It takes on human or animal form on occasion, but the reader doesn't develop any real sense of dread from ""the dark,"" and no real feel for an the intelligence/plan at work behind this force.  The suspense wasn't there for me - I'll just say even when ""the dark"" succeeds, it feels ... generic, not personal.So, while the author had some original elements mixed together in creative ways, she did not tie them together into a tight narrative that pulled me along.  I would say this is more for long-time fantasy fans, rather than general readers with an interest in fantasy."

Amazing series. I loved these books as a kid, I still love them now.",15/01/2021,"Susan Cooper's ""The Dark Is Rising"" series was my favorite as a young teen.  Now that my son has started reading them, I'm reading them again, too.  But honestly, I've re-read them several times in the years in between as a mature adult.  Wonderful!  A bit simpler than the Harry Potter books, this imaginative and exciting series is great for kids around the age of 11, the same age as Will in the story.  Start with Book 1 ""Over Sea, Under Stone"" if possible.  The series is best read in sequence for maximum enjoyment."

OK---One of my faves!",27/07/2004,"On the eve of his eleventh birthday, Will Stanton's world began to change, drawing him into a legacy that would change his life--and the story of the long conflict between the Light and Dark for the fate of the world.For he was the last of the Old Ones, quasi-immortals born to keep the world from domination from the Lords of the Dark. And in his time of learning, from the strangeness of his birthday eve to the worst danger on MidWinter's eve, he set in motion a quest for the six great Signs of the Light that alone could save the world from domination by the last and greatest rising of the Dark.I adore this series, and this is one of the best written books in it. I'm fascinated by Will's double nature and enjoy characters like Merriman, Hawkins. And I'll never listen to Greensleeves again without thinking a little of the chimes of doors of time, or the hint of Paul playing a very old flute.Marvelous.This is a sequel to Over Sea, Under Stone."

A highlight of my adult life was heading to Wales and seeing Lake Llyn and Cader Idris!Though this book is the second in the series, it does stand alone as a starting point (and is, in fact, the one I originally started with).

A good novel",09/06/2018,"I found it compelling. There were a few passages I'd have liked phrased differently, they were a little awkward or obscure. I can practically guarantee everyone thought that but of different passages. It's that sort of book. However, it doesn't get in the way of anything.I would recommend the series. This is no Harry Potter, though, so anyone expecting that sort of fantasy will be disappointed or at least confused. Nor is this Tolkienesque.

Good read",05/12/2008,"I feel like all I do is give Terry 5 stars when I rate his books, so if I had to give a 4 star, it would be to the Black Unicorn. Why? It's probably my least favorite in the Landover series. I just finished reading it for the second time and although I thoroughly enjoyed it, it just didn't grab me as much as the other books in the series. It reminded me of books like The Last Unicorn and Alice in Wonderland. I am saying this in reference to the Unicorn and Cat charachters in the book. I think Terry was trying to revive some of our old childhood stories and present elements of them in a new light. Still, I loved the book, just not as much as the others:)This book also turned me against Willow's father. (Really have harsh feeling for him after 'Wizard at Large, haha.)I will add though that any new readers to the Landover series, will love this book and if you are a fan of the Shanara series, you'll like how the Landover series isn't actually setup like a trilogy, where one book continues into another. They are all chronoligical, but each book presents new adventures, so be prepared for fun, suspense and excitement."

oldie but goodie",26/09/2013,"Started the Landover series in 1985 but never finished. Don't really remember why. Could have been that I considered the Shannara saga more appealing at the time or had started reading Salvatore or Jordan books. Either way, after almost 30 years I picked this series of Brooks books back up. Magic Kingdom was better than I remembered (except for the too often use of the ""in style"" use of 80's foul language in a fantasy novel) and this book The Black Unicorn was even better. I am now reading Wizard at Large and am probably 1/3 through that book and at the moment am not nearly as taken as I was reading The Black Unicorn."

Great book in series - Kindle version still plagued with errors",05/07/2009,"I read the entire Landover series years ago and was happy to see them in Kindle format. I finished the first one - Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold! and was very disappointed at all the spelling & formatting errors, but since it was free, I couldn't complain too much, right?So I purchased ""The Black Unicorn"" - Kindle version. Again, on just about every other page there are misspelled words, formatting errors, strange characters (print type, not story type.) I'm really shocked at how poorly these things have been converted to Kindle format.As a comparison, I read the Kindle version of the first Shannara trilogy and don't remember any errors, if there were, they were few.I've written Amazon, got the standard canned (thank you for your feedback) response and also wrote to the publisher - Del Rey but haven't received a reply yet.I'm taking 2 full stars off this time for the poor conversion to Kindle format. The book is great but since I'm reviewing the Kindle version, it loses points.I just ordered the 3rd one in the series (stupid, I know) but I'm curious to see if there are still errors. If so, I may ask for a refund.To summarize: Great book, poor conversion to Kindle format."

Great classic SF",03/12/2023,"A classic work of science fiction, I, Robot is a collection of short stories. Each story is narrated by Dr. Susan Calvin on the eve of her retirement. Most of the stories have a logic puzzle: why is the robot behaving in this fashion. It was fun to reread these and find myself just as fascinated as I was in high school. The book does make me question the state of the world as we stand on the edge of a world with AI.I would strongly recommend this book to any fan of science fiction."

His insights into what life might be like in our time is pretty sweet. He gets a lot wrong and a lot more right about the implications of AI on work, governance, culture, that gamut.The characters are thin, but that’s true of 95% of the sci-fi and fantasy genres."

Wonderful, Insightful",12/11/2023,"Sometimes, you finally get around to reading a book everyone calls a classic, and when you finish, your first reaction is, ""Yep, that was a classic."" And such as it is with I, Robot, Isaac Asimov's groundbreaking science fiction of a future inhabited by robots. This review won't spoil anything, but the number of concepts and ideas Asimov anticipates is incredible. Accelerating technological developments today and driving conversations about ethics, the limits or danger of artificial intelligence, the future of work, and many other issues. Asimov writes about this and more in the decades-old book."

Hard to read",14/01/2024,The book started with a family that had a robot that played with and watched their child. I thought the story would take the course of more robots in society with increasing abilities until they took over. Unfortunately the actual story went from one scenario where the robots exhibited some type of glitch that was discussed to the point of boredom to another scenario that discussed other glitches and on and on. Towards the end the robots were created in human form and people didn’t know if they were human or not. Very hard to read. I skipped sections that seemed to have no purpose or ending.

Friendly nice stories about robots",04/04/2023,"This book is a loosely connected series of stories about robots. Each of them is a chapter and each chapter addresses a dilemma which the 3 rules of robots are key to solve. In that way, each chapter is entertaining and surprising in its own. Overall they tell a story, but there is no overarching argument, which is why I give it only 4 stars. Because each chapter is independent and thus doesn't build into something bigger"

Great Book",28/11/2018,"I, Robot is a great book to read and I would recommend it to everyone. Asimov used the cultural trend of futuristic science and the fear of what could happen extremely well. Through each story humanity was faced with a new challenge and fear. Robots in the book were becoming more and more like humans. In the way of developing personalities and eventually realizing that they are superior. This is the biggest fear of robotics then and even now.I personally enjoyed reading I, Robot. Reading about the types of fear that people had during Asimov's time and its relevance now makes the book more personal. The constant struggle between technology and humans is an everyday challenge for us now and Asimov depicts our lives now almost to a ""T"". The point of complete independence for robots is in the not too far future for us, especially with the develop of super computers like Watson and Amazon's household aid Alexa.The book from an academic standpoint is phenomenal. Asimov uses the fear from his current day and the use of what could possibly happen and turns it into a very real situation. The book works as a conglomerate, keeping each story distinctive, but working as a whole to the conclusion. The stories add to each other to show the development of technology over time. All of the developments lead to the last story and the struggle of humans losing control of themselves. I would have liked to have known more details about how each development of robots affected the world around it and the consequences or benefits from these developments through out time."

Still a classic",17/04/2007,"I, Robot bears more resemblance to a series of short stories than it does to a true novel.  While certain characters recur through most of the stories, each segment is pretty well self-contained within a loose framing story.  While time has obviously passed this book by in some respects (some dates for the events have already passed), it really doesn't damage the story in any meaningful way.  The characters are interesting, the story is strong, and the overall themes are just as valid today as the day they were written.The common thread running through these stories is the ""malfunction"" of robots and where their artificial nature ends and whether life begins at some point.  I don't want to spoil details for those who haven't read the book but is interesting how many of these apparent malfunctions turn out to be something very different once the robot's perspective is understood.  In fact, as we gain a deeper understanding of robots, it seems like we also gain insight into ourselves.All in all, I found this book interesting and entertaining.  I liked it enough that I will buy the second in the series and that may be the strongest recommendation I can give.  I have seen a few reviewers trash the book for not being the same as the movie, apparently ignorant of the fact that this book is nearly 60 years old and that it is the filmmakers who cashed in on Asimov's work and not the other way around.  As long as you don't expect to find a Will Smith clone in here and take it for what it is, I would recommend I, Robot with no reservations."

Review from someone new to Asimov",17/02/2015,"I stumbled upon Isaac Asimov books a few weeks ago after seeing a tweet (yes, shameful on my part) from Elon Musk about the Foundation series.  I started out reading ""Foundation"" but then quickly felt I should look further into these stories because I just like I wanted to know more of the history. It's a long story but I basically did a bit more research and found that ""I,Robot"" was one of the first books I should read as it provided the framing of the entire Galactic series.  I believe there are about 16 - 18 books which covers the Robots, Galactic Empire and Foundation stories (each having a set of books).  And although you can read each set of books on their own e.g. reading just the Foundation books is perfectly fine......you would do yourself an injustice by skipping the other sets as the all give notes of origin to certain characters and elements to each future story.  As other reviewers note, this is a collection is short stories and not a novel of one.  I just finished this book and now moving onto ""The Complete Robot""........and from the two books I've read/listened so far, I have not once been disappointed.  There were moments OMG when there were revelations in the story which I did not foresee.  One thing you should take into consideration.....while I think anyone would enjoy this book, don't compare it to the movie.  It is, as mentioned, a collection of short stories and only ties in some of the characters from the movie.  And while I think anyone would enjoy this book, do read it as a stepping stone.  You will be glad you did."

I'm such a slacker.",10/04/2021,"First, I didn't buy and read this until long after watching the I, Robot movie with Will Smith.  Secondly, I didn't write this review until about 7 years after reading the book.  I kind of think it's neat how the part of the book that evolved into the movie is really just a short story.  Then again, they got Maximum Overdrive out of what (as memory serves) was a 2 page short short story in a Stephen King book.  Anyway, back on topic - As a sci-fi fan I was really disappointed in myself for not reading this sooner.  It was quite enjoyable.  It's interesting to see where other authors have built on stuff like this.  If it's so awesome why not 5 stars?  Because I haven't felt any particular desire to go back and re-read it in the past 7 years."

Read it in the context of its own time",12/03/2006,"I first read _I, Robot_, 25 years ago. And, like everybody else, I was floored by the depth and simplicity of the Three Rules. (Personally, I liked the R. Daneel Olivaw series better, where Asimov puts his human protagonist in the unwilling role of solving murders... and the three laws are just as important there.)I re-read the book after seeing the movie, once I realized how little I'd remembered of the book's details. And I was surprised to see just how little of the book was used; it's basically the presence of Dr Susan Calvin (who isn't supposed to be pretty) and the three laws. The rest of the movie is a figment of someone ELSE's imagination. (It's entertaining, by the way, as long as you don't expect anything of Asimov in it.)What struck me in re-reading the collection of short stories is how much it's a function of its time... for both good and ill. When Asimov wrote these stories, for instance, the idea that a woman could be the pre-eminent robopsychologist was not a typical belief. More power to him for creating the character; but a modern reader won't have the same expectations as would a reader from the book's original era. Imagine seeing Star Wars for the first time, today; you'd think, ""THOSE were considered awesome special effects?!"" because the world has moved on since then. But this is what set the bar for classic SF, just as Star Wars influenced sfx forever.DO read this book; there's a reason this is considered a classic. However, keep in mind that its slightly thin and wooden characterization (Susan Calvin comes alive only because Asimov's thin brush strokes are so precise) was a function of its time."

Great Classic Asimov",10/11/2018,"A while ago, I got sick of binge watching mindless shows and decided to binge read some of the classics of science fiction. I had not read any Asimov before, and figured that I, Robot was a good starting point. This book is actually a collection of short stories that take place in a future which doesn’t seem all that remote these days. Robots, and more importantly, the “positronic brain”, have become the leading technologies. In the early stories in the book, robots and their brains are in their earlier stages of development and they evolve considerably throughout the book. What I like about these stories is the fact that the underlying stories and their nuances are solid and well developed, while the robots and futuristic technology are more of a setting. Central to these underlying stories are the Three Laws, which lead to many unique and interesting problems. While this probably isn’t Asimov’s greatest book, it is an excellent introduction to his overall style. This book is a great starting point, and it got me hooked. As a result, I wound up reading the Robots series, the Galactic Empire series, and the Foundation series. Give it a try. You may get hooked too. On another note, the movie of the same name really doesn’t have much to do with the book. The movie took bits and pieces and then built around them."

A classic",20/07/2022,"I, Robot is a sci fi classic of collected short stories by Asimov — published in 1950. Interesting to see what Asimov, a prof of chemistry, was able to predict and not predict about the world 70 years down the road. What is clever in the book is how a robot psychologist is able to get into the mind of robots and even out smart them. You can also find some precursors of Star Trek and Star Wars in the stories (e.g. hyperspace). No aliens or ETs however. A fun quick read."

Robots must follow the rules...",10/07/2004,"Re-reading ""I, Robot"" before the movie comes out was a good idea, I'm glad I did.  For me, reading Asimov if often a fond trip down memory lane.But if you have never read Asimov or looking for somewhere to start, I would highly recommend ""I, Robot"" as a first glimpse into Asimov's world(s).  Here is a wonderful and timeless collection of nine short stories that all center around a central theme; The Three Laws Of Robotics.The three laws are: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.  2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.These laws are the central theme to each individual story, and connecting them is a running ""Runaround"", ""Reason"", and ""Catch That Rabbit"".  Always under the direst of circumstances, they must figure out the malfunction of the robot before something terrible happens.  Very entertaining stories.Some of the other stories are about Dr. Calvin's personal experiences, such as ""Liar"" and ""Little Lost Robot"", but all fall back onto the laws as their basic theme, and whether or not humans will ever accept robots among them.Once finished with ""I, Robot"", I very highly recommend the ""Foundation"" series, one of my favorite Asimov themes, along with the Robot Trilogy and another favorite, ""Nightfall"".  Asimov has the gift of creating lively, likeable characters with a technical backdrop to his all-to-human stories, and always infuses a bit of humor into them.Truly one of the great masters of Sci-Fi, Asimov is a must-read in my opinion, and ""I, Robot"" is a wonderful starting point.Enjoy!"

Great stories, bad narrator",27/07/2005,"(I'm reviewing the audio CD edition.)I've always loved these stories.  Warmly human, insightful, clever and entertaining.  Asimov's diction sometimes sounds very old-fashioned, and his characters can seem a tad cliched or flat.  But the stories themselves are hugely entertaining.My disappointment is with the narrator.  I've heard this narrator on one other book, and I didn't like him in it, either.  But in that case, I hated the book (a pulp fiction mystery--I should have known better).  I've come to realize that this guy simply doesn't know how to narrate.  He seems to feel that he must cram as much emotion as he can into every sentence.  The truth is that, in most cases, most of the time, narrating doesn't requiring any serious emoting.  So he's always giving emotional spins to lines that shouldn't have any.  Rising inflections cause sentences to end with an interrogative tone that they shouldn't have.  Long pauses in the middle of sentences imply things--sarcasm, doubt, fear--that the text doesn't justify.  Characters come off as sounding smarmy, even insulting, when in fact they were intended to speak straightforwardly and sincerely.Even when the text does have a certain level of emotion in it, the narrator's reading is unpredictable.  Sometimes he does a good job;  other times he sounds like he's trying too hard.  It's not that he over-emotes, necessarily.  It's more a matter of sounding convincing.  Some readers can narrate the most wildly maudlin or melodramatic scenes, and sound convincing.  Others can't manage to portray mild surprise convincingly.As a result, I've found that I can only listen to this book a bit at a time, because I grow so thoroughly annoyed with the narration.  I have to mentally re-speak the words inside my head, shorn of all the overwrought histrionics.Ironically, this problem ends on the last story of the book.  It's a much more detached, dry, analytical story than all of the previous stories;  a good bit of it is narrated by a character.  So we have a narrator reading a character who is himself narrating.  Suddenly, the goofiness of the narration in the earlier stories is gone.  I won't say that he reads like a robot (to make a bad pun), but he simply reads normally.  They way I wish he had read the entire book.  Yet the story, although interesting, is probably the least fun to listen to, because it is so analytical.My only other quibble (a very minor one) is Will Smith's face on the box.  This book has nothing to do with the horrid movie of the same name.  This book contains the original stories, not the shoot-'em-up story in the movie.  The publisher should have been able to divine that the people who would bother to read Asimov's stories are not at all the type of people who would go see Will Smith playing his usual grin-and-shoot macho action hero character.  And if anyone bought this audio book thinking that it would be (one shudders to think) some sort of dramatization of the movie, they would be awfully disappointed.Overall, I can't recommend this book simply because of the narration.  Hopefully there will one day be a better narration."

Pleasant Read, if not as Good as the First",15/03/2016,"I read the original Stargirl in high school. It was one of the greatest literary surprises I've ever experienced and a testament to the warning not to judge a book by its cover. It remains one of my favorite books to this day. I was not aware of a sequel until I was a number of years older and I snapped it up immediately.Several readers have posted negative reviews based on the fact the title character is now the narrator. Her enigmatic presence is punctured in the sequel as we see the world through her eyes. This is not a negative thing. It's fine to not enjoy this perspective if what you enjoyed about the first book was Stargirl as an ideal, but as a character, I felt the sequel humanized her in a way that was very positive. She's still an atypical, altruistic, even magical girl, but one who has experienced the sting of heartbreak and has sobered. Just a little. She deals with responsibility. She questions romance. She's a person and an interesting one.Her pining throughout the book for Leo, the narrator of the first novel, has been highlighted by some reviewers as a flaw. I disagree. Every one of us has experienced that before. I can look back through my own diary entries from high school and see how desperately involved I was with the fleeting romances of teenagerhood. This is a normal part of growing up and I believe the book handles it in such a way that we can all relate.The diary/letter format may throw people off as it is very different from the linear narrative of the original, but I found it interesting. I enjoy diaries and have long kept one myself, so the story felt more organic to me in this format. It won't work for everyone and that's understandable.The book isn't perfect. Many of the side characters feel phony. A few of them serve as walking literary devices with no personality of their own, which feels a little heavy handed much of the time. Even the better characters seem to serve limited purpose beyond providing Stargril a platform from which to speculate about the universe. The first book captured high school students more organically. The writing, while in no way bad, seems to falter in finding its voice. There are ""entries"" that I can believe were written by a teenage girl and others that feel like I'm reading a YA novel. I expected Stargirl's voice to be more dynamic and captivating.Even with its flaws, this is a good follow up to the first book. It's a short, entertaining read with some legitimately inspiring passages. If you loved the first book, spend the few dollars to snag this one. It's worth your time."

Attending Stargirl's solstice",08/10/2014,"I might as well add my voice to the chorus of people who loved this book.  A big improvement on the first (and not just in terms of length).  In this story we get to see the world from another character prospective, one that was fairly mysterious in the first book, owing much to the prospective given.  The cast are interesting and varied and there are some things done I didn't expect, but more on that later.As you probably already know, this book is written in the tense of a letter, which has been done before, but is done very well here.  I really enjoyed getting recaps of the day, sometimes weeks, after they happened.  What's better is that because this was written usually the end of a day, you could see the shifting and altering mindset of the character as she wrote the letter.  One thing that was done that was different and I loved was how the letter style is not constant.  Sometimes it's a summary and feels like a novel, sometimes it's random rambling and others it is broken up by poems and such.  It was pretty brilliant.The characters are also pretty spectacular, though I wish Stargirl had more friends  her age.  Actually the fact that she didn't might of been kind of the point, so I won't hold it at all against her (or the author).  The book is a lot longer than the original, which is great, but honestly I could of done with even more.  There are a lot of things this book started to touch on that I wish it had explored to greater depth.  Additionally I would like to have seen more about what stargirl thought about different things in life; However - the fact is the picture you are given is complete enough that I don't feel I need the author's hand holding to have a pretty good idea about how she would of reacted in different situations that the book doesn't present.There are some surprises and twists and turns I didn't expect and while the book is pretty generally a happy story, I think it improves on the already spectacular book one in just about every way.Oh and on the title of the review. . Read the book and you'll understand."

For me, Stargirl Represents the Desired Evolution of Humanity",14/10/2018,"In “Love, Stargirl”, the sequel to “Stargirl”, the main character’s family has already moved from Arizona to Pennsylvania where Stargirl returns to homeschooling after her short time in a real school in Arizona didn’t work out. In Arizona she was shunned by a mean mob of her peers for being a wonderful, positive role model.If humanity ever evolves into something better, we should learn from Stargirl. But, sad to think, there is only one Stargirl, and she is a fictional character in two books. Hopefully there will be a third book in the future.I read and reviewed “Stargirl” first before buying this sequel. The prequel earned five stars from me but this book is so much better because it is told from Stargirl’s point of view instead of Leo’s, the boy she left behind in Arizona after he dumped her. Of course, the reason he dumped her was because he caved in to peer pressure from a mean mob of other children who thought being too positive was wrong.I don’t think Stargirl is capable of a mean thought or behavior. After what Leo did to her in Arizona, how can she still love him like she does? To Stargirl, it seems Leo is her want-to-be Romeo and she is holding on to hope that he will evolve to her level. Is this wishful thinking? Unless there is a third book that includes Leo, we will never know.Stargirl is an incredible character and I want to know more about her life and friends. Because this book is told from her point of view, we meet all of the friends she makes in Pennsylvania: Dootsie, Betty Lou, Alvina, Perry Delloplane, and more. Each of Stargirl’s new friends is a unique individual as seen through the main characters eyes and thoughts. If we learn anything from the two books, we discover that being an individual is so much better than being the member of a mob of biased, like-minded people."

Excellent, but not quite as good as Stargirl.",31/05/2014,"You have to have read Stargirl, the first of the books, in order to understand Love, Stargirl.I was thinking it might be a good read for my fourth graders, but it is definitely too old for them.  Stargirl is a great story, and it is written in a fun way, but the content is much more suited to 8th graders and up.  The readability is fine for younger kids, but the subject is over their heads.A few of my students started Stargirl, but they lost interest.  Younger kids just don't get, and shouldn't get, the problems of high school kids.I loved the book, the story, and the creative way it is written, but wait 'til you're 14 to read it!I am now reading its sequal, which is not as good as Stargirl."

Magic",31/03/2011,"This review courtesy of Squeaky Clean Reads ([...])Overall Review:  Magic. That's what this book is full of: Magic.  How so? you might ask. There were no magic spells or magicians or incantations... No, there weren't, but there was magic nonetheless. There is magic in seeing the small and seemingly insignificant things going on around you. There is magic in taking joy in a moment or celebrating a day. And what is more magical than watching a transformation? A person becoming or overcoming? How about befriending a 6 year old? Did you know 6 year olds are magic? They are. An incredible magical journey to a Winter Solstice is made--where the magic brings people together who love each other because first they were loved.  In reference to the first book titled ""Stargirl"", written from the point of view of someone else, I heard tell of the disappointment of humanizing Stargirl in this volume.  Humanizing? Where? I beg to differ. What human can make that sort of magic happen? There are some humans out there like her, admittedly, but they are few and far between. We see them and always wonder, ""How do they do it?"" How?  Beautifully and poetically written.  Overall rating is 5 out of 5 stars!Content Review:VIOLENCE: one mild instancePROFANITY: few mild instancesSEXUAL CONTENT: NONEMATURE THEME: MildRECOMMENDED AGE GROUP:  14+A wonderfully written, squeaky clean book.  The only violent part is when a character gets angry and beats someone up.  It's not graphically written, but another character sees and is very shaken.  There are less than a handful of swear words--so unusual when writing about teenagers!  There is no sexual content (two characters kiss, but there's nothing sensual about it).  I considered this to have a mild mature theme only because of the thought provoking nature of the novel.  ""Love, Stargirl"" is a Squeaky Clean read for 14+!This review was written by EmilyA Squeaky Clean Reads Book Reviewer"

Sequel to Stargirl",03/02/2018,"This is the sequel to Stargirl, and it is written from the perspective of Stargirl herself.This story is written as a very long letter in the form of a series of diary entries. The letter is addressed to Leo, her ex-boyfriend from the first book.When I picked up this book, I wanted to know more about Stargirl. I wanted to know more about the ethereal and unique girl who sang happy birthday to strangers, who wore interestingly different clothes, and who seemed to have an endless amount of kindness.As I read this book, I realized that Stargirl, deep down was still a normal child. She experiences anger, heartbreak, disappointment and terror, like any other child. I also realized that the reason why many viewed her as such was because we were viewing her through the eyes of Leo, an eager, youngster who had fallen in love with Stargirl and viewed her through a certain lens.This book delves into Stagirl's everyday life: her homeschool activities, how she interacts with others, how she views others, her family, her ""milk runs"" with her father, and the inner workings of her mind. It's quite an interesting read, but the Stargirl you see here may be a different girl than the person you saw in Stagirl (the first book). Nevertheless, this is still an interesting read regarding a kind girl who celebrates her uniqueness and is willing to reach others."

Theme: Individuality vs. Conformity",26/02/2017,"The Stargirl series has been very popular in my special education classroom (5th-6th grade) this year.  One of my reading groups completed the Stargirl novel unit at the start of the school year and they requested that we read this one next because they weren't ready to say good-bye to the characters.  Cheers to Jerry Spinelli for creating a character who celebrates the uniqueness in all of us!  My students definitely connected with a main character who wasn't like everyone else, and who loved herself for who she was.  My students are very proud of themselves for understanding (and recognizing story examples) of individuality vs. conformity.  I couldn't be more pleased!"

I love ""Love, Stargirl""!",02/05/2013,"This book is written in the form of a novel-length letter, over the course of year, to the boy who broke the eccentric home-schooler's heart. It follows (the self-named) Stargirl's acclimation to small town Pennsylvanian and the relationships she forges as she gets to know interesting people around her and herself.""Love, Stargirl"" is a sequel to the Spinelli's best-seller ""Stargirl"", which is referenced throughout the book. This works great if the two are read in reverse order (""Love, Stargirl"" and then ""Stargirl""). All the reminiscing is new to the uninitiated reader and builds intrigue about her past with  Leo and Mesa, AZ. The first book (""Stargirl"") -- the better written of the two -- then fills in the gaps, and provides a proper ending for the series.Endearing and well-written, it happens to feature -- and be accessible to -- teenage readers, without being dumbed down or condescending.All in all, great books. Highly recommended. But please please please read this one before the other one."

Okay",07/07/2018,"Okay I was a little disappointed with this after liking Stargirl a lot. I can't put my finger on why I didn't like it, but it didn't feel the same you know? Stargirl is still my precious cinnamon roll that I want to protect with every fiber of my being but I didn't care for some of the characters and her being friends with an actual child that is 5 or 6. I didn't mind her being friends with 'A' I just can't recall her name but it was weird and I'm pretty sure it had a 'c' in it. Her group of friends were just weird but I expected that from Stargirl.Is it weird that I like the whole harem thing with Perry? I feel weird for liking it and was happy that it wasn't really looked down upon and caused no drama between those involve."

Stargirl...again",30/11/2012,"This review is a strange one for me. I am a special ed teacher, and I have discovered Jerry Spinelli as an author who my students read in their accelerated reading goals....and ths I discovered the title 'Stargirl"" lasyt year in my gen ed teachers classroom. I borrowed it, read it, and then realized that I AM a Stargirl!!! I AM this character! And I am not alone!! So, it ws a happi discovery that there was a sequel called Love, Stargirl. It picks up where she left off, it tells what happens to her when she left her state of Arizona, and relocated. And if you process stuff the same way I do, you understand how this book gets on, and developes, but the ending you will have to read for yourself.I am a Stargirl fan!! But then...I AM Stargirl!

The mysteries of Stargirl are answered...",09/03/2011,"and it's sort of a shame that they are.Stargirl's appeal in the first, ""Stargirl,"" is her quirky, mysterious personality. The power of Stargirl lies in not understanding her quirky ideas and actions. This book answers too many questions to keep Stargirl that girl of mystery and independent womanhood.My main concern is the length of time she's stuck on Leo Borlock. The entire book is a letter to Leo and even after Stargirl is told repeatedly that she shouldn't live in the past and that she should get over Leo. She knows this. She UNDERSTANDS it, and yet, independent individual that she is, can't move on until the last two pages of the book. This goes against everything Stargirl is and is made to be in the first book. And also doesn't go very far in showing young girls the value of moving on after a tough relationship. Perhaps this is a normal teen girl response, but this normal response is exactly what makes it so anti-Stargirl.Which is not to say that the book isn't beautifully written, or that it's not filled with Stargirl's trademark quirks and Jerry Spinelli's incredible sense of humor.It just seems to be a forced sequel rather than an organic extension of a story..."

Surprisingly Good...",09/07/2014,"The path that led me to reading this book is a strange one.  Apart from the premise, I knew precisely squat about this book or the author, Jodi Picoult.  But I was overwhelmingly surprised.  This was a very good book and I will be on the lookout for more of Picoult's work.  I'm always a fan when there's a female protagonist, and one in law enforcement is only a bonus.  Delia Hopkins is smart, feisty, caring, and sharp as a tack.  Even when her idyllic life in New Hampshire is shattered by the revelation that her name isn't Delia and that, while being her biological parent, her father had taken her from her mother in Arizona when she was a little girl, violating a custody agreement with his ex-wife.  With her father headed back to Arizona to stand trial for kidnapping, Delia and her daughter follow him while her fiancée, a lawyer, takes his case with the aide of a local friend.  The centerpiece of the trial becomes Delia's memories of a past she always thought she was only imagining.  All the while, her father sits in the county jail, with a cell mate who's career in the free world is a meth dealer/cook.  This book is often sold as an exploration of memories.  With this sort of marketing strategy, I always fear the possibility that the central element of the plot will overshadow everything else.  This thankfully was not the case.  The exploration of memories, specifically Delia's memories, was nicely integrated and it was all more interesting as a result.  This book was interesting across the board.  The characters, many of them trading off narrating duties, were all well-developed.  The scene descriptions of New Hampshire and Arizona were all breath-taking...I totally want to visit these places.  Best of all, this unabridged audio book had a different voice actor every time a different character took over as the narrator.  That alone was absolutely great as it gave even more life to these characters, many of whom I was already willing to sit down with for coffee.  For all these elements and more, I absolutely recommend this book and I'm convinced that Jodi Picoult is just as great in her other works.  Enjoy."

""Recollections are in the eyes of the beholder.""",29/03/2005,"Cordelia Hopkins makes a living finding lost people. She and her beautiful bloodhound, Greta, have a terrific track record for leading successful search-and-rescue missions. They're very good at what they do. As ""Vanishing Acts"" progresses, it becomes obvious that Delia has had an unusually intense interest in loss, of both people and memory, stemming from her third year of life.Raised by her warm and loving father, Andrew, Delia had as happy a childhood as anyone could wish for. Her dad, a widower, was always right there for her. She could talk to him about anything...and she still can, she believes. Sometimes, she would think about what it would be like to have a mother and fantasize about meeting her in heaven. Her mom died in a car crash when she was a small child. On the other hand, it seems to Cordelia that she and her father have lived forever in the same cozy house in rural New Hampshire, just the two of them. He has run a local senior center there for as long as she can remember, and has always been active in community affairs. Although she has vague memories of a woman who smelled of vanilla and apples, Delia remembers almost nothing of her life prior to Wexton, NH.Her two next door neighbors are her two best friends and have been for most of her thirty-two years. She grew up with both of them. Eric Talcott, her fiance, is the father of her pre-school daughter, Sophie. They are in the process of planning their wedding. Fitzwilliam MacMurray, (Fitz), formed the other part of their triumvirate from the time they were little kids. They were a ""fungible"" trio, as Fitz once put it. In high school, when Eric and Delia fell in love, the three-way friendship continued and still does, years later.  Eric is now a lawyer, and Fitz a journalist.As Sophie grows from a toddler to little girl, Delia begins to remember more about her own life at her daughter's age. Images, sounds, the feel of the sun on her head, bring back fragmented memories from another time - people, voices and a place she just cannot identify. Then one evening a policeman knocks on the door with a warrant for her father's arrest, and her life and world are turned upside down.""Vanishing Act"" is written in the first person by each of five main characters: Delia, Andrew, Eric, Fitz, and  Elise. Each point of view provides part of the puzzle that is the history of the Hopkins' family. I am a big fan of the author's and have never disliked any of her novels. There are some books by Jodi Picoult which I love, and others I would prefer not to read twice. ""Vanishing Acts"" is in the latter category, and is probably the book I like least by Ms. Picoult. The narrative feels forced, even erratic at times, and disturbs the natural flow which usually marks the author's work. She has added unwarranted drama, which fits neither the storyline nor the characters. There are scenes from prison life that, although fascinating, are tremendously distracting and excessively violent - to no purpose. Certain characters, dialogue and scenarios are just out of place and make an otherwise believable plot incredible. Unnecessary touches, like change of font and the use of boldface type to distinguish between characters' stories and chapters, are also awkward. It is as if the author could not count on the strength of her plot and storytelling ability to sustain the novel, and needed to go for the artsy effect to provide a worthy result.On the other hand, there are people who surface here, like the Native American woman, Ruthann, who is a jewel of a character - and a prime example of what Jodi Picoult fans look for when we purchase her novels without a second's thought. I am glad I read the book. I would have been sorry to miss it. However, read parts of it in a bookstore before you decide to make a purchase. Otherwise, wait for it to come out in paperback or go to the library.JANA"

Love this Author",03/04/2005,"Once again Jodi Picoult does not disappoint me.  She can write about real life family situations with such a reality you feel the characters.This about a child who is ""kidnapped"" by her father and does not know about it until 28 years later when he is arrested for the crime.It delves into her life now, before and after.  There are so many lies and situations that are hard to comprehend.Ms Picoult writes from everybodys perspective.  The daughter, father, mother, lawyer, boyfriend,lover, grandchild. They all play a part and have their story.  You learn about the courtroom procedure and how one survives prison and many other unbelievable and real situations.Once again, I loved a Jodi Picoult book.

Good Story Line",28/06/2013,"I really liked the story line of this novel. I think Jodi Picoult takes controversial issues and attacks them from all angles. In this case, the reasons a father would kidnap his daughter from her custodial mother and then change their identities and keep it a secret from her for 28 years. I feel kind of bad criticizing the author, but I have noticed that of the Jodi Picoult novels I've read, her style almost never changes.  She duplicates names from novel to novel - for example, how many people named ""Fitz"" have you ever met, yet I've come across characters in two of her books with that name.  And the fact that she tells the story from up to 6 different characters point of view (each character's narration is a different typeface also) and it tends to be confusing. Jodi is a very intelligent woman (just read her bio) who has a masters degree and has been educated at the likes of Harvard and Princeton - which is great, but I tend to zone out sometimes because I don't always understand what she is talking about.  Her characters tend to have unusual hobbies and she goes into detail explaining what they're thinking (such as how stars come to be or what the Greek gods have done or in one case, the history of the Hopi Indians) which usually has little to do with the story line.  Also, she tends to make the characters a bit unreal by having them always say things that are really out there (an example is when Delia's thoughts were something to the effect of if she touched the sky and the desert with a pin, the air would be let out of everything in the world - what????!!!!)  None of these things would keep from reading Jodi's books and they may not even bother other readers.  I read a lot of books by a lot of authors, and it's hard not to compare the styles that you may like better or form your own opinions about the stories or authors.  All in all, I would recommend this book.  It was a good read, and as always, these are my own opinions and you may think differently."

Then she proceeds to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, trying to show us how clever she is, how much research she's done, how many characters she can juggle and have them all somehow magically provide just the perfect insight to one another that they needed. I've now read several of her books, because I keep wanting to give her another chance, but this is it for me.Here are some of the worst faults of this book: First off, the use of alternating points of view, complete with different fonts as a visual aid. But then the voices themselves are all completely identical - the overly poetic, self-important voice of the all-knowing writer. Why bother to use this device at all if you can't make it more convincing that we're actually getting inside the heads of the different characters?Then, the excessively long sections about life in prison, complete with gangs, nicknames, ridiculous Latino and Black dialogue, and jailhouse poetry... oh, come ON!! I was actually embarrassed for Picoult the first time that awful rap appeared, and then she just couldn't help herself, she did it again. I literally could not bring myself to read more than a few lines, and finally just had to skip the rest of the prison sections altogether.***SPOILERS***Just when I'd had about enough of the quirky Native American neighbor, Ruthann, she actually takes Delia and Sophie off on a road trip with her to the Hopi Reservation. And when she jumps to her death from the ancient cliff dwellings, we get Delia, in her rampant conceit, believing that Ruthann purposely brought her along because she knew Delia and her bloodhound would be able to track her and somehow 'bear witness' to her suicide.Then, oops! Eric starts drinking again, and Delia falls into bed with Fritz (except it's the back seat of her car, just emphasizing how adolescent this whole triangle really is). But WAIT! Eric is actually okay with it, but still somehow expects Delia to come back to him when he gets straightened out, yet again.Finally, there it is, the characteristic Picoult twist at the end: Andrew drops the bombshell in court that Victor was abusing his daughter... no wait! It's a double twist! Delia starts to remember the abuse herself... no, it's a triple twist!... Andrew admits to her that he might not have even seen anything at all, but only convinced himself of it based on his suspicions...I could go on and on, there is so much to dislike about this book. Just read all of the other 1-star reviews, I agree with everything they said!"

Exquisite Writing",29/05/2023,"No detail too small.  Human characters.  Lush layers of storyline.  Deep, thought provoking while being an enjoyable read.  Loved it."

Meh",08/04/2023,This is the first book by Ms. Picoult that I did not care for. Unrealistic/improbable story lines and an abrupt conclusion.

Raises Many Issues, Legal and Moral",16/03/2020,I just read some past reviews of this book which were pretty scathing.  I can’t believe we read the same book. I can overlook flaws in writing if the story and characters grab me.Yes the story was a little disjointed and perhaps padded with extraneous sections. But I think the author was making a point about prison conditions although Andrew did take on Walter White qualities. But you do what you have to in order to survive. I found the Hopi culture sections interesting. Author also making a statement on repressed memory.

Pretty Good... First timer",02/03/2006,"I definitely think that Jodi Picolt is an amazing and inspirational author.  Her writing is so vivid and her characters come alive.  Vanishing Acts is the first book that I've read by Picolt and I have to say it will not be the last.  While it seems at times that the story is in different places and all over, it all comes together at the end.  My only thing is that I like closure - since it is a novel and I won't ever get to know how the story really ends!  No spoilers here, but I wish I knew a little bit more of what really happens to everyone after all is said and done."
